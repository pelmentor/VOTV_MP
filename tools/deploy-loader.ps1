# deploy-loader.ps1 -- install the STANDALONE shipping loader into VOTV.
#
# Copies the xinput1_3.dll proxy + votv-coop.dll payload next to the shipping
# exe. On game start the proxy is loaded (VOTV imports XInputGetState/SetState
# from xinput1_3.dll, and the exe directory wins the DLL search order over
# System32); its two exports are forwarded to System32 xinput1_4.dll, and it
# loads votv-coop.dll automatically -- no injection, no UE4SS (RULE No.3).
#
# This REPLACES the dev-only inject.ps1 path. UE4SS (dwmapi.dll proxy) is left
# untouched; it coexists. Use -Standalone to also disable UE4SS for a clean
# no-UE4SS proof (renames dwmapi.dll <-> dwmapi.dll.off), and -Remove to undo.

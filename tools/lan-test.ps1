<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Two-instance LAN coop test framework (RULE 1: a real cross-process test, not the
    single-process loopback). Launches TWO VotV instances -- one host, one client --
    each in its own net role, and verifies they discover each other and exchange
    state over real UDP (separate sockets, real handshake, no self-send).

.DESCRIPTION
    Both instances load the SAME mod DLL from the SAME game dir, so they cannot be
    configured by per-file scenario.txt / votv-coop.ini. Instead each is given its
    role/peer/port/nickname AND its own log file via ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES the harness
    reads (VOTVCOOP_SCENARIO / _NET_ROLE / _NET_PEER / _NET_PORT / _NET_NICK / _LOG).

    PASS criteria (parsed from the two logs -- the deterministic proof):
      host   log: "CONNECTED (host)"   + "Client joined the game" + net stats recv>0, puppet=1
      client log: "CONNECTED (client)" + "Host joined the game"   + net stats recv>0, puppet=1
    The DISTINCT nicknames crossing over (host sees "Client", client sees "Host") prove
    real cross-process exchange -- impossible in the self-loopback.

    Screenshots of both windows are captured best-effort as artifacts (sequential
    foreground BitBlt; 3D frames are black under PrintWindow).

.PARAMETER Port        UDP port the host binds / the client targets (default 47621).
.PARAMETER TimeoutSec  Max wait for both to connect + exchange (default 240; two
                       instances boot + load story under CPU/GPU contention).
.PARAMETER NoBuild     Skip the cmake build + deploy (use the already-deployed mod).
.PARAMETER Keep        Leave both instances running after the verdict (for inspection).
.PARAMETER ResX/-ResY  Per-window resolution (default 1280x720 so two fit on screen).

#
# We TRIED retargeting to Game_0.9.0n_dev/ (the new Claude-owned dev
# copy with UE4SS) but hit a regression: both instances reach
# "harness: target STORY save 's_may2026'" and then silently die before
# the save-load completes. Cause is unknown -- possibly a first-launch
# asset-cache initialization race when two fresh game instances boot
# simultaneously from a freshly-cloned game folder. The dev copy
# launches a SINGLE instance fine; the failure is specific to two
# concurrent fresh boots.
#
# Workaround: keep lan-test pointed at the well-warmed Game_0.9.0n/
# folder (which has run lan-tests many times this session without
# issue). The dev copy is still valuable for solo RE work (Live View,
# Lua probes, GUIUFunctionCaller hypothesis testing). When the two-
# concurrent-boot issue is solved, switch back. See

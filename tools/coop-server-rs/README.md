# coop-server-rs — VOTV coop master + signaling (Rust)

Rust port of `tools/coop_master_server.py` + `tools/coop_signaling_server.py`.
**RULE 3: VPS infra, it never ships in the mod.** Wire-compatible with the Python
originals (identical JSON endpoints, identical signaling line protocol, byte-exact
coturn TURN credential) so old + new can run in parallel during cutover.

Status: **AS-BUILT + wire-verified against the Python** (differential smoke, 2026-07-16),
NOT yet deployed to the VPS. coturn stays as-is (not ported).

## Binaries

| bin | replaces | default port | env |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coop-master` | `coop_master_server.py` | `COOP_MASTER_PORT` (10001) | `COOP_TURN_SECRET`*, `COOP_SIGNALING_TOKEN`*, `COOP_SIGNALING_URL`, `COOP_STUN_URI`, `COOP_TURN_URI` |
| `coop-signaling` | `coop_signaling_server.py` | `COOP_SIGNALING_PORT` (10000) | `COOP_SIGNALING_TOKEN`* |

`*` required — the process refuses to start (exit 1) without it, same as the Python
`FATAL` guards. All secrets are ENV-only; nothing is hardcoded (keep it that way).

## Build

```
cargo build --release      # -> target/release/coop-master(.exe), coop-signaling(.exe)
cargo test                 # unit tests incl. the byte-exact TURN-cred vector vs Python
```

Cross-compile for the Linux VPS (from Windows) once cutover is scheduled, e.g.
`cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (needs the linux target +
a linker; or build on the box / in CI). A single static-ish binary per service — no
Python-on-VPS runtime to bitrot.

## What is faithful to the Python (verified)

- **Endpoints**: `/v1/host`, `/v1/heartbeat`, `/v1/leave`, `/v1/visibility`,
  `/v1/join`, `/v1/lobbies`, `/v1/latest`, `/healthz` — identical JSON field names,
  status codes, and error shapes (31/31 differential checks).
- **TURN credential** (the byte-exact spot): `username = "<unixExp>:<label>"`,
  `password = base64(HMAC-SHA1(TURN_SECRET, username))`, `ttl = 120`, two `?transport`
  URIs. Unit-tested against a fixed Python reference vector.
- **Security posture**: rightmost-`X-Forwarded-For` from a loopback proxy only
  (spoof-proof rate/target IP), constant-time token compare, opaque `lobbyId` vs
  secret `sessionId`, `clamp_str` control-char strip + codepoint clamp, per-(IP,class)
  sliding-window rate limits, global LRU + per-IP lobby caps, `LOBBY_TTL` sweep,
  bounded header/body/conn caps + read timeouts.
- **Signaling**: `<token> <identity>` greeting, `<dest> <hex>` relay, pre-auth vs
  authed pools, per-IP caps, evict-on-duplicate-identity.

## Where it IMPROVES on the Python (behaviour-equivalent, not a wire change)

- **Concurrency**: multi-thread tokio + a single `Mutex<MasterState>` (master);
  one-task-owns-the-socket `select!` (signaling). No lock is ever held across an
  await — mirrors the Python asyncio single-loop safety without giving up cores.
- **Signaling evict-on-dup is immediate + clean**: dropping a peer's relay-channel
  `Sender` closes the channel, so the old connection's `select!` sees `recv()==None`
  and shuts its whole socket down at once — no reliance on the OS to unwedge a stale
  reader (the Python `prev.close()` path).
- **Relay backpressure**: a bounded per-destination channel (drop-on-full) replaces
  the Python 5s drain timeout — a slow destination can never head-of-line-block a
  sender, and memory per destination is hard-bounded.
- **serde typed JSON** deletes the hand-rolled dict-key validation.

## Cutover (per the migration plan)

Wire-compatible, so: run the Rust services on **different ports** alongside the
Python ones, point one test client's master URL at the Rust master, verify a real
host+join+relay, then cut the production master URL over and retire the Python
(RULE 2 — the `.py` files go once the Rust is proven in production, no dual-run kept).
`LATEST_PROTO`/`LATEST_MOD`/`LATEST_URL` + `LOBBY_TTL` are operator constants in
`src/bin/master.rs` — keep them in sync with any Python-side change until cutover.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Log-truth assert harness for the chipPile carry/throw/dup coop sync.
  Reads the HOST + CLIENT votv-coop logs and checks the invariants we otherwise grep
  by hand every test round, emitting one PASS/FAIL line per invariant + an overall
  verdict + exit code (0 = all pass, 1 = any fail). The log is the channel of truth;
  this replaces the manual eye+grep loop so iteration can run without a human tester.

.DESCRIPTION
  Each invariant is a named check over the two logs. The harness is DATA-DRIVEN: add a
  new invariant by appending one entry to $Invariants. Born 2026-06-22 to catch the
  take-31 regression (derived piles broadcast ToPile at (0,0,0) -> snapped to the world
  origin -> "disappeared"); the ToPile-loc-nonzero invariant is the live regression unit.

.PARAMETER HostLog / ClientLog
  Paths to the two logs. Default to the LAN host/client game folders.

.PARAMETER Scenario
  Optional label, printed in the header (e.g. "take-31-regression").

.PARAMETER Quiet
  Only print the summary table + verdict (skip per-invariant detail lines).

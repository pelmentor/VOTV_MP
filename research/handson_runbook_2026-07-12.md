# Hands-on runbook — 2026-07-12, TAKE 6 (the JOIN BARRIER — architecture, per rule 1)

Take-6 ran on DLL **`7030160D`** (md5 first 8; PASSED — see RESULT below). Currently deployed:
**`4B2E4024`** = the same barrier + the take-7 anti-smear instrumentation (see TAKE 7 at the
bottom). Commits `bbf91f39` (the barrier) + `7847021e` (audit-CRITICAL fix: the off-GT Arm race --
probe session now opens on the GT via an atomic request).
SUPERSEDES take 5 (`0DA4FAE0`) BEFORE it ran: the user mandated the architectural fix of the
two-authority join seam with fresh context; take-5's mechanisms (wire-order netting, spawn
revalidation) are now RETIRED — the barrier makes their bug class structurally unreachable.

## What this build IS

The MTA join barrier (INITIAL_DATA_STREAM shape): the client announces `ClientWorldReady` only
when its loadObjects tail has SETTLED (the same population-stability probe the doom sweep always
trusted, now owned by `coop/session/world_load_episode`). The host therefore streams the ENTIRE
world state (R2 deletes -> snapshot -> state lanes -> teleport) into a settled world. No wire prop
expression is ever provisional; wire events apply strictly in arrival order. Roots 1/2/4/5 of the
placed-prop saga die structurally; roots 3+6 (duplicate save keys) stay fixed by the take-4
KEY-UNIQUENESS re-key authority (unchanged in this build).

User-visible deltas (expected, by design):
- The joiner stays under the loading cover ~5-20 s LONGER (the world genuinely settling; the
  reveal now lands in a FINISHED world instead of mid-churn).
- The joiner receives NO live host events during its load; the post-settle snapshot carries their
  net effect.

## Test steps (the take-2/4 repro IS the acceptance test)

1. Host: load the usual save ("Host game"). Client: connect; WHILE the client sits in the connect /
   world-load window, host hold-R a world rock into the hotbar and place it back somewhere visible.
2. After the client is in: the placed rock EXISTS on the client, at the host's placement spot.
3. Take-2 regression: a rock from pre-connect hotbar stock placed in-window also appears.
4. Join regression sweep: props/piles/kerfurs present, mushrooms/garbage not doubled.
5. fps sanity post-join (the take-3 2.5fps class).
6. Bare-join host-wipe regression: host keyed-prop census stable across a client join (episode
   destroy-broadcast suppression unchanged but now self-closing).
7. If convenient: cave in/out on the client (travel re-announce waits for the new world's settle —
   host re-replay lands post-settle; nothing should vanish/double).

## What to read in the logs

CLIENT (the load-bearing sequence, in this order):
- `world_load_episode: ARMED ...` then `world_load_episode: quiescence probe ARMED (join world-load)`
- `world_load_episode: load-tail QUIESCED (population stable; session 'join world-load') -- episode
  CLOSED ...` — the barrier edge. A `DEGRADED` variant here = the deadline fired (pathological
  load; the settled-world guarantee did not hold — report it).
- `net_pump: ClientWorldReady announced (world up + registry coherent + load tail quiesced)` —
  STRICTLY AFTER the QUIESCED line, and no PropSpawn/PropDestroy receive lines before it.
- Then the snapshot bracket + `join_membership_sweep: divergence sweep FIRING (probe latched ...)`.
- NO `[SPAWN-DEFER]` / `SUPERSEDED` lines anywhere (that machinery is deleted); NO dead-row
  tripwire for the rock's key.

HOST:
- `[PILE-1C] slot N world-ready -- JOIN-WINDOW CLOSED` arrives LATER than before (at the client's
  settle) — expected.
- First load of a poisoned save: the `KEY-UNIQUENESS ... re-keyed -> 'rk_...'` burst (root-6 fix
  working; `re-key FAILED` lines = regression, stop and report). ~0 after the game re-saves.

## RESULT — TAKE 6 PASSED (2026-07-12 13:21, user hands-on + log-verified)

User verdict: "rock are present" — the in-window placed rock (the take-2/4 repro) exists on the
client. Logs pulled to scratchpad (`take6_host.log` / `take6_client.log`) before any relaunch:

- CLIENT sequence exactly per spec: `world_load_episode: ARMED` 13:20:27 → probe ARMED 13:20:29 →
  `load-tail QUIESCED ... episode CLOSED` 13:20:38 → `ClientWorldReady announced (world up +
  registry coherent + load tail quiesced)` STRICTLY after. **0 PropSpawn/PropDestroy receives
  before the announce line** — the entire connect replay (incl. all rock spawns) landed in a
  settled world. No DEGRADED, no `[SPAWN-DEFER]`, no tripwire.
- Sweep: post-snapshot probe session QUIESCED 13:20:42, `divergence sweep FIRING (probe latched;
  2340ms after arm)`; `BIND SUMMARY -- bound 872/872`.
- HOST: `[PILE-1C] slot 1 world-ready -- JOIN-WINDOW CLOSED` 13:20:38 (at the client's settle, as
  designed). KEY-UNIQUENESS: **162 re-keys, 0 `re-key FAILED`** — the `460da7e4` SuperStruct-climb
  works on the live save.
- Health: 0 `[ERROR]` both peers; WARN census = perf telemetry + kerfur census only; client
  workingset ~3.0 GB stable.
- NOTE for the kerfur anti-smear follow-up: the save had **ZERO kerfurs** (census: 0 NPC + 0 PROP
  both peers) — take-6 exercises NO kerfur layer; live-evidence retirements there need a
  kerfur-present run.

## TAKE 7 — the KERFUR-PRESENT join (anti-smear evidence run)

Deployed DLL: **`4B2E4024`** (md5 first 8), all 4 installs hash-verified. Same barrier build +
anti-smear INSTRUMENTATION ONLY (no behavior change): both adoptions log `poll #N, M ms after arm`
at bind/fresh-spawn; TRIPWIRE WARN if the 60 s adoption timeout fires before quiescence; two stale
spawn-revalidation comment/log references in join_membership_sweep rewritten (RULE 2). NOT smoked
(instrumentation-only build; user at PC).

Steps (any order, one session is enough):
1. Host: load a save (or play until) at least ONE kerfur exists — ideally one OFF (prop form)
   AND one ACTIVE (NPC form). The vending-machine kerfur purchase works too.
2. Client: join. Optionally: while the client loads, host turn a kerfur ON (the in-window
   turn-on exercises the retireOffEid chain).
3. In-game sanity: exactly one of each kerfur on both peers (no doubles, none missing);
   client sees the active kerfur move.

What the logs must show (client, the anti-smear evidence):
- `kerfur-prop-adopt: bound ... poll #N, M ms after arm` — the K-6 collapse case needs **poll #1**
  on every join-path adoption (or no arm at all: exact-key bind won). Any poll #>1 = the wait
  branch is still load-bearing, keep it.
- `npc-adopt: bound ... poll #N ...` — same reading.
- ZERO `TRIPWIRE -- last-resort timeout fired BEFORE load-tail quiescence` lines (a hit = the
  probe/sweep chain wedged — report immediately).
- `[KERFUR CENSUS][CLIENT] TOTAL ...` — 0 UNTRACKED + 0 UNCLAIMED, and TOTAL equal to the host's.
- RE-BIND ledger continues: count `keyed churn RE-BIND` hits (take-6: 0).

## RESULT — TAKE 7 (2026-07-12 13:58, user hands-on + log forensics)

USER: 6 kerfurs / 4 active on BOTH peers — counts match. Adoption evidence (the measurement this
run existed for): 2 NPC adoptions bound **poll #1** (81/93 ms); 2 NPC + 1 prop kerfur had NO local
twin (not in the blob) → fresh-spawned at poll #12 when the sweep latch fired — correct per design.
RE-BIND ledger: 0 again. TRIPWIRE: 0. **K-6 collapse verdict: NOT collapsible — the fresh-spawn
fallback fired on a real join (twins genuinely absent), so the wait-then-fresh-spawn branch is
load-bearing. The K-6/npc_adoption join-wait machinery STAYS. The anti-smear candidate list for
adoption is CLOSED (keep).**

NEW BUG found by the user (floating CCTVs) → root-caused + fixed, see TAKE 8.

## TAKE 8 — the CHILD-ACTOR EXCLUSION (floating-CCTV root fix, per rule 1)

Deployed DLL: **`DE4B438A`** (md5 first 8), all 4 installs hash-verified. Audit: 1 CRITICAL found
(the steady re-seed incremental-express lane bypassed the first 4 gates AND the gated destroy seam
would have made its orphans permanent) → closed same session at SeedWalk_ + BuildPropSpawnPayload_
(now 6 surfaces, one predicate); all other audit dimensions CONFIRMED sound.

THE BUG (take-7, user: «камеры внутри 3 керфуров ... в воздухе cctv у них троих в груди»):
kerfur eye cameras are `prop_camera_good_C` — keyed Aprop-lineage CHILD ACTORS (UChildActorComponent
`cam` on both kerfur forms). Our prop identity layer treated them as independent world props:
- HOST enrolled + broadcast them (`name='cam_b_1'` PropSpawns, waves at every kerfur toggle) →
  the joiner materialized STANDALONE floating camera mirrors at each kerfur's chest (eid
  9558/9567/9569 = exactly the 3 visible CCTVs).
- The JOINER's own eye cams (keys are per-peer random — kerfur loadData never restores Key) were
  unclaimed at the sweep → DOOMED (take-7 log: `doomed 2 x 'prop_camera_good_C'`).
- Gap-I-1 30 cm fuzzy sometimes STOLE a live eye cam under a wire key (eid 9568/9575/9576/9580).

THE FIX (mirrors the game's own rule, `Aprop_C::ignoreSave = ignoreSav || IsChildActor()`,
prop_base bytecode): ChildActorComponent-owned actors are excluded from the independent prop
identity universe. ONE predicate `ue_wrap::engine::IsChildActor` (raw reflected
AActor.ParentComponent weak-ptr read, off-GT-safe), consulted at: MarkPropElement (the ONE enroll
owner → element table, key index, R2, snapshot, reaper, sweep universe all covered), the Init-POST
broadcast catch, the destroy seam, and the FindNearbySameClass fuzzy candidate walk.

Test steps (kerfur save, both peers):
1. Client joins → NO floating CCTVs anywhere; kerfur counts still match (6/6, 4/4).
2. Client log: ZERO `remote_prop::OnSpawn: cls='prop_camera_good_C' name='cam_b_1'` lines and
   ZERO `doomed N x 'prop_camera_good_C'` in the sweep. Expected instead (host+client):
   `child-actor enroll REFUSED cls='prop_camera_good_C'` / `skip (parent-owned sub-actor...)`.
3. Host toggles a kerfur off + on while the client watches → no camera appears/orphans on either
   peer; the kerfur morphs correctly both ways.
4. Regression: a USER-PLACED standalone camera (prop_camera_s/cursed/good bought+placed) still
   syncs both ways (place, move, stick) — standalone cameras are NOT child actors and keep their
   wire identity (take-7 log showed cursed+s cameras syncing; that must not regress).
5. fps sanity + the take-6 rock repro still green (barrier untouched).

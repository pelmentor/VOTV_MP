# Destroy-seam blast radius (HOST-WIPE) + R-drop rock invisibility — RE 2026-07-08

**Two DISTINCT bugs that share the v106 `K2_DestroyActor` Func seam. Do NOT unify their fixes**
(the adversarial-agent caught an over-unification: a "client never authors keyed destroys" blanket
would be a RULE-1 suppress-X AND wrong for the rock). Both are RE/log-derived this session; NEITHER
fix is designed or built. Piles are OUT of scope (already fixed; do not touch).

Deployed at investigation time: DLL `753bb549` (rock `[ROCK-DROP]` diagnostics, UNCOMMITTED). HEAD `8cae8597`.

## BUG A — HOST-WIPE: client join-window purge churn wipes the host's keyed props

**Status: CONFIRMED on a CLEAN BARE-JOIN log [V log 2026-07-08 11:54] — zero player action, no rock, no manual
pile-throw. v106-regression = STRONGLY supported (clean bare-join wipe + pre-v106 counterfactual). Fix = DESIGN
only (not started). TOP PRIORITY: a bare join empties the host world -> coop is unusable. Rock (Bug B) is PAUSED.**

### Symptom (user, hands-on)
"Last time host world had no PROPS at all, they got removed." The host's keyed props vanished en masse. Reproduced
on a deliberate bare-join test 11:54: client connected, user did NOTHING, host world emptied anyway.

### What the CLEAN bare-join log proves (11:54 run — no rock, no manual grab/throw either side)
- **Bare, verified**: `grab_hook[grab]`/`grab_hook[throw]` = **0 on BOTH host and client**; `[ROCK-DROP]` = **0**.
  Zero player action — the "did NOTHING" claim is log-verified, not asserted.
- **Timeline**: join `BeginConnect` 11:54:24 -> peer slot 11:54:26 -> `BeginSnapshot` (3183 objects) 11:54:33 ->
  CLIENT broadcasts **3,140 DESTROY** = **2,269 keyed props @11:54:38** (`eid=0`, `key='FXMI...'`, the wipe) +
  871 eid-only trash clumps @11:54:35 (pile-dedup) -> HOST receives 3,140 `OnDestroy`: **RESOLVES 2,066 by key
  -> "destroying local actor"** (the wipe), DEFERS 1,074 eid-only (no matching actor = harmless).
- **Host wiped, verified**: host re-seed went **3,345 -> 1,255 live keyed props** (2,099 dying) at 11:54:42, and
  **1,255 is the LAST re-seed before shutdown (11:54:52)** — the host never recovered. ~2,090 keyed props gone.
- This ISOLATES the leak: it is inherent to the join reconcile/purge, fires on a bare join, and is NOT the
  pile-throw stress (there was none this run).

### What the earlier BRAIDED log first showed (11:06 run — join + pile-throw, superseded by the clean 11:54 run)

### What the log proves (HOST=`Game_0.9.0n_HOST`, CLIENT=`Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_1`, 2026-07-08)
- **11:06:44** — CLIENT join hits a world/level-change reconcile: `re-seed found 2556 live keyed props ... 857 dying`.
- **11:06:46-47** — CLIENT fires **2,270 keyed-prop DESTROY broadcasts** (`grab_hook[destroy-seam]: CLIENT
  broadcasting DESTROY ... key='FXMIrEnEjutSmIrUQwLOvw' eid=0`), and the **HOST executes 2,066 `OnDestroy ...
  eid=0 -> destroying local actor`** in the SAME 2-second window. Near 1:1. Host had ~3,343 keyed props seeded
  (11:05:29) -> ~2,066 wiped -> host world emptied.
- **NOT the claim sweep**: the sweep fired 9 s LATER (11:06:55) and destroyed only **110** locals; the pile
  completeness floor kept the chipPiles (docs/piles/10 fix working).
- **NOT piles**: victims are KEYED props (`eid=0`, key-authored — `drone_InventoryContainer` etc.), NOT
  chipPiles (eid-only, key=`None`, floor-protected).

### Mechanism — REFINED by reading the 11:54 origin (two DISTINCT destroy populations)
Reading the destroy burst in the 11:54 log (not inferring from the count) splits it into two populations
with DIFFERENT origins, timings, and host impact:
- **871 eid-only trash-clump destroys @11:54:35** = the CLIENT's pile-twin DEDUP (`[PILE] DESTROY native
  level-pile twin ... proxy is the sole mirror now`). These carry the client's LOCAL eids (e.g. 42821) which
  the host does not have -> host `OnDestroy` **DEFERS (1,074 "no local actor")** = HARMLESS. Piles stay out of
  the wipe (consistent with piles-already-fixed; do not touch).
- **2,269 keyed-prop destroys @11:54:38 (single frame), 2,268 in ONE frame** = the actual WIPE. They carry
  real save Keys (`key='FXMI...'`, `drone_InventoryContainer`) -> host `OnDestroy` **RESOLVES 2,066 by key ->
  "destroying local actor"** -> host world emptied. The burst fires immediately after an ENGINE-side GC hitch
  (`[HITCH] frame=69ms ... GC/render/physics -- permanent-both-peers GC signature`) during the save-load
  world-swap (host save `zcoop_6800.sav` written 11:54:30, client loading it).
- **What the log does NOT record: the CALLER of those 2,269 `K2_DestroyActor` calls.** The destroy-seam log
  line prints the broadcast, not the callstack. So WHICH exact code path issues the keyed-destroy burst (our
  reconcile/dedup of local keyed twins vs a BP vs GC-coincident world teardown) is STILL RE-pending — needs a
  callstack in the diagnostic or the dispatch-route RE. "reconcile/purge" was an inference; the measured facts
  are the timing, the count, the key-resolution, and the GC-hitch coincidence.

### Root FRAMING — NAMING THE CALLER IS A PRECONDITION (both live hypotheses presuppose it)
- **The candidate `InPurgeEpisode()` gate is TIMING-INVALIDATED by the log.** net_pump raises the mass-purge
  flag at **11:54:40** ("reaped 256 >= 64"), but the keyed-destroy wipe fires at **11:54:38** — the flag is
  NOT set during the burst. Whether gated on the client SEND or the host EXECUTE, `InPurgeEpisode()` as wired
  would be inactive at the moment of the wipe. It also only removes a timing-classified subset. => skip-flag in
  a nicer hat (RULE 1), and it does not even cover this window. DEAD.
- **PRECONDITION (adversarial-agent, correct): the fix framing cannot be chosen until the CALLER of the 2,269
  keyed `K2_DestroyActor` calls is named.** The two live hypotheses each PRESUPPOSE a different caller:
  - **(H1) FIRING-SET / §8 narrowing** — if the caller is the GAME's world-swap TEARDOWN (client tearing down
    its OLD world to load the host save), then the v106 seam — built to carry **eid-only clump/pile morphs** —
    is now ALSO firing on **keyed-prop world-teardown it was never meant to carry**. Fix = narrow the firing
    set back to its intended payload, NOT an authority gate. This is the LEANING hypothesis: (a) no our-code
    reconcile-destroy marker precedes the burst in the 11:54:37-39 window (only `CreateOrAdoptPropMirror` binds
    + pile morphs); (b) 2,268 destroys in ONE frame right after a `[HITCH] 69ms GC` during the save-load = a
    bulk engine teardown, not an incremental reconcile. CIRCUMSTANTIAL — the seam logs no caller.
  - **(H2) AUTHORITY asymmetry** — if instead a deliberate client reconcile-diff compares client-world to
    host-world and destroys "dupes", the root is that the client authors keyed destroys at all (it already
    SKIPS keyed SPAWNS at `prop_lifecycle:195`); fix = client keyed destroys are LOCAL-ONLY, symmetric with
    the spawn skip.
  - Both converge on roughly the same code IF the discriminator is keyed-ness; they DIVERGE on justification
    and edge cases. **A candidate INVARIANT worth testing in the RE (not yet confirmed): the wipe destroys are
    `eid=0` (key-only) because the element was ALREADY DRAINED before the actor died = teardown/GC ORDER; a
    genuine tracked player-intent destroy would carry a LIVE eid.** If that holds, "client broadcasts a keyed
    destroy only when the element is still LIVE" gates teardown without a timing flag and without blanket
    keyed-suppress. Must verify (does the rock R-pickup carry a live eid? do all teardown deaths present eid=0?).
- **DECISION GATE: the dispatch-route RE (name the caller + the eid-liveness at the seam) is a PRECONDITION for
  the root analysis, not a follow-up.** Only after it does H1-vs-H2 resolve and the discriminator get chosen.

### v106-regression evidence (now STRONGLY supported)
| | client `broadcasting DESTROY` | host `OnDestroy` executed |
|---|---|---|
| pre-v106 (`research/crash_2026-07-03_rehost_wispkill`, PE observer) | 840 | **10 — no wipe** |
| post-v106 bare join (2026-07-08 11:54, Func patch `29dfd079`) | 3,140 | **3,140 -> host 3,345->1,255 = wipe** |

Logic: the mod shipped working joins before v106 (joins did not empty the host). Post-v106, a BARE join with
zero player action empties the host. The only thing that changed the destroy DISPATCH set is the v106
`K2_DestroyActor` Func patch (it catches a wider firing set than the old PE observer). Combined with the pre-v106
counterfactual (10 host destroys on a rehost, no wipe), this is strong regression evidence. Caveat: the pre-v106
row is a crash-REHOST, not a clean join, so the counterfactual is directional — but it no longer gates priority
or the "is it real" question; the clean 11:54 bare-join log settles both.

### ISOLATION status
1. **USER — clean bare-join repro: DONE (11:54 log above).** Host wipes on a plain join, zero player action,
   no rock, no manual pile-throw. The leak is inherent to the join reconcile/purge, not a pile-throw trigger.
2. **ME — dispatch-route RE: still useful, but NO LONGER blocking.** It is no longer needed to establish THAT
   v106 regressed or the priority (the clean log + counterfactual carry those). Its remaining purpose is to
   LOCATE the fix: confirm the client's join-purge keyed destroys dispatch via the `EX_CallMath`/native route
   the PE observer could not see -> the classification gate (`InPurgeEpisode()`) belongs AT the v106 seam, not
   bolted on elsewhere. Feeds the fix design, not the diagnosis.

## BUG B — ROCK R-drop invisibility (client places a pre-existing rock -> host can't see it)

**Status: ROOT RE-derived from bytecode + code [RD 2026-07-08]. NOT captured in a real log this session
(`[ROCK-DROP]`=0 in the 07-08 run — that run was pile-throw-during-join, not a rock repro). Fix shape
UNSETTLED. Needs a CLEAN rock-only repro.**

### Symptom (user, "from other times")
CLIENT picks up a rock with **R**, holds it, places it with **R** -> the rock is invisible to the HOST until an
E-grab (and "sometimes even E can't recover it").

### Ground truth (RE agent, mainPlayer bytecode + `ue_wrap/prop.cpp`)
- A "rock" is a generic **`prop_C`/`Aprop_C`** instance (name-driven from `list_props`), a KEYED interactable
  (Key @0x02E0). `IsDescendantOfProp`/`IsKeyedInteractable` both true.
- **R = the `drop` input ACTION.** Decision tree: `grabbing_actor` valid -> Hold-into-hand; else `holding_actor`
  valid -> `simulateDrop` (PLACE); else `lookAtActor` valid -> `Hold Object` (PICK UP into hand).
- **R-pickup**: `Hold Object` -> `getData`@1653 -> `addEquip`@1699 (which SYNCHRONOUSLY calls `updateHold` ->
  `FinishSpawningActor`@1217 = hand DISPLAY actor born) -> `ac.K2_DestroyActor()`@1754 (world rock DESTROYED).
  So the hand successor is born BEFORE the world prop dies (migration window EXISTS) — but the successor is a
  display-only, per-switch-churning hotbar actor, not a world entity.
- **R-drop/place**: `simulateDrop` -> `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` + `FinishSpawningActor`@117551 ->
  `loadData`(restores save Key) -> a **FRESH `Aprop_C` world actor**. **R-DROP IS A SPAWN** (this REFUTES the
  v106 model's "an R-drop/place is NOT a spawn" claim in COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md:29 — corrected 2026-07-08).
- One R-pickup destroys **exactly one** world prop; no mainPlayer mass-destroy loop (rules the blast-radius OUT
  of the mainPlayer R path — the host-wipe comes from the join reconcile, Bug A, not here).

### Mechanism (code-proven)
1. R-pickup destroys the world rock -> the bidirectional destroy seam broadcasts `DESTROY(eid=X)` (client
   `prop_lifecycle:376` -> host `remote_prop_destroy:84`) -> **host loses its copy** (eid retired both peers).
2. R-drop spawns a FRESH `Aprop_C` on the client -> its Init-POST spawn-catch **silently returns at
   `prop_lifecycle:195`** (`if (IsDescendantOfProp(self)) return; // Aprop_C host-authoritative, skip client
   broadcast`) -> **host never told -> invisible.** (Added a `[ROCK-DROP]` diag there to make the silent skip
   visible.)
3. E-grab re-expresses via the `grabbing_actor` lane (`EnsureHeldItemBroadcast`) — "sometimes" because if the
   fresh rock became tracker-known, that path DECLINES at `trash_collect_sync:339` ("pose stream suffices" — a
   false promise for a no-longer-streamed prop).

### Fix shape — UNSETTLED (do NOT build without green-light; feature-grade)
- Candidate discriminator "owns an eid at pickup" REJECTED (doesn't separate suspend-into-hand from a genuine
  delete — both drain the row).
- §9-clean shape (successor claims eid at its birth -> the pickup-destroy resolves a husk, no skip-flag) is
  FEASIBLE (migration window exists) BUT the successor is the churning display hand actor -> fragile; collides
  with the v105 "hotbar = player expression, not a world entity" decision (`project-hand-item-axis-2026-07-06`).
- One-owner (RULE 2026-05-28): route through the EXISTING held-prop author seam E uses, NOT a new drop-seam path.
- Spans hand_item + destroy seam + element registry + author seam = feature-grade -> §1 written root analysis
  + explicit per-rule-1 green-light BEFORE design. Fix N=1 rock first, generalize at N>=3 (§11).

### Coupling to the host-wipe fix — CORRECTED: NOT forced to pair; host-wipe ships ALONE
Earlier claim "the authority-fix STRANDS the rock -> they must pair" was an OVERSTATEMENT. Reality:
- The rock's R-pickup broadcasts `DESTROY(**eid=X**)` — a LIVE eid (the rock is tracked). The host-wipe destroys
  are `eid=0` (element already drained = teardown). So the eid-liveness invariant (gate `eid=0` keyed destroys)
  fixes the host-wipe and **does NOT touch the rock's eid=X pickup broadcast at all -> rock UNCHANGED.**
- Even under a blanket keyed-suppress, removing the client's keyed-destroy broadcast would only make R-pickup
  leave the HOST's copy in place (host shows a stale rock at the pre-pickup position instead of nothing) — a
  DIFFERENT desync, not a WORSE one; the rock is already host-invisible on R-drop regardless.
- => Nothing FORCES pairing. **Host-wipe fix is shippable ALONE; the rock defers** to the clean intent-channel
  hook (route R-pickup/R-drop through the held-prop author seam). Verify the "unchanged vs stale-at-old-pos"
  distinction with the rock repro when the rock work starts; it does not gate the host-wipe.

### Diagnostics added this session (RULE-2-exempt, log-only, UNCOMMITTED, in DLL `753bb549`)
- `prop_lifecycle.cpp:195` — logs the silent client-Aprop spawn skip (`[ROCK-DROP] CLIENT Aprop spawn NOT
  authored ... key eid loc`).
- `trash_collect_sync.cpp:339` — logs the tracker-known DECLINE.
- `hand_item.cpp` `ExpressReleasedHandActor` — logs whether prev survived (release) or died (destroy+respawn).

### Clean rock-only repro (PENDING user): pre-existing rock, NO join, NO piles -> R-pick -> R-drop -> check host
-> E-grab -> reload. Read HOST+CLIENT `votv-coop.log` for the `[ROCK-DROP]` lines + the destroy/spawn pair.

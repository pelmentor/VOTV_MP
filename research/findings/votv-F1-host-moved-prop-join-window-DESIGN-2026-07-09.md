# F1 — host-moved keyed prop during a client's JOIN WINDOW shows at the SAVE pos — DESIGN 2026-07-09

STATUS: DESIGN, PROVISIONAL. `/qf` R1-R5 (2026-07-09) converged on a DIRECTION + a hard gate: **MEASURE
FIRST (a read-only probe), design not ratified until the probe runs.** Independent of the
keyed-prop intent lane (that is client->host grab/drop; this is host->joiner position).

**PROBE BUILT + DEPLOYED 2026-07-09 (commit 7acd887d, DLL AAC8502CFAA78871, all 4 folders hash-matched).**
`coop/dev/join_window_pos_trace.{h,cpp}` -- CLIENT-side, ini-gated [dev] join_window_pos_trace=1 (added
off-by-default to the CLIENT_1/CLIENT_2 inis). AWAITING a hands-on repro run (host moves ONE keyed rock
during the client's join window; read the client log's `join_window_pos_trace: VERDICT` lines). The
reconcile (piece 1) + the send-side settled-skip + the pile-only apply-time settled-skip (piece 2) stay
UNBUILT until the probe's verdict discriminates root (1) loadObjects-clobber from root (2) host-held.

## Symptom
The HOST moves a keyed world prop (rock) DURING a client's join window; after the client finishes joining
the prop renders at its OLD SAVE position, not where the host moved it. User-reported ("host moved two
rocks during a join window of the client"). NOT yet confirmed in a live join log.

## Root (MEASURED in code; the CAUSE itself still INFERRED — probe pending)
- The main connect-snapshot SENDS the keyed prop at the host's CURRENT position (`prop_snapshot.cpp:301`
  GetActorLocation), delivered PRE-loadObjects, and applies it at OnSpawn (`remote_prop_spawn.cpp:492`
  SetActorLocation, DRIVE-SKIP gated at :418 — skip if the host is holding it). [measured]
- The client's own loadObjects (save-load) RECREATES the keyed prop at its SAVE position, AFTER the
  snapshot -> overwrites the host-moved pos. [INFERRED from ordering + the b3 comment save_transfer.cpp:585-588]
- The keyed churn RE-BIND (`join_membership_sweep.cpp:257-269`) migrates the mirror row's IDENTITY (eid)
  onto the loadObjects recreate via RegisterPropMirror(rebindInPlace=true) — it does NOT re-apply POSITION.
  The mirror row stores NO transform (`prop.h:31` "UE owns transforms"). [measured]
- No lastHostXform cache exists. [measured]

## Converged direction (`/qf`): ONE host-authoritative live-pos reconcile (generalize b3)
F1 and the shipped **b3 pile hole are the SAME missing owner**: "the joiner's save-load clobbers any
host-in-window move." b3 being chipPile-only (`save_transfer.cpp:618` IsChipPile gate) is a §8 site-list.
FIX = generalize `FlushDivergedPilePositionsForSlot` into ONE reconcile at quiescence for EVERY
save-authoritative entity (keyed props + piles): send `PropSnapPos{eid, host-LIVE-pos}` where the host's
pos diverges; the client snaps the bound actor post-loadObjects. Read the host's LIVE pos (host-authoritative,
fresh) — NOT a client-cached snapshot pos (REFUTED: stale + non-authoritative + a second author lane).
- The `PropSnapPos` receiver core (`ArmPendingPosCorrection`, `event_dispatch_entity.cpp:408`) is already
  eid-generic; the `:411-422` overlay (`UpdateChipHostPos` / `ArmHostVacateTwin`) is chip-specific — a keyed
  branch uses the generic snap and SKIPS the chip identity overlay.
- SETTLED-SKIP at SEND (host side): skip an entity the host is currently HOLDING/driving (a mid-carry
  live-pos read is transient/undefined).

## The LATENT b3 APPLY-TIME GAP (found via the user's grab-during-window edge case, MEASURED)
`ApplyPendingPosCorrections` (`quiescence_drain.cpp:337-380`) re-validates ONLY liveness (`IsLiveByIndex`,
:346) at apply-time, NOT held/converted. So if a grab lands BETWEEN arm (PropSnapPos receipt) and apply
(quiescence sweep), eid E is now a CLUMP (grabbed pile) and the correction `SetActorLocation`s the CARRIED
clump to a ghost pos. This is a latent bug in the SHIPPED pile lane (snapshot-before-state-ready, OPUS §5),
not just F1. FIX: apply-time settled re-validation (skip if the bound actor is now held/converted/driven).
- Scope note (/qf R5-Q1): for a ROCK, hold-R pickup DESTROYS the world actor -> eid DEAD -> the liveness
  check ALREADY drops it. So the apply-time settled-skip is a PILE-ONLY concern (a clump survives liveness);
  do not over-generalize it to rocks before rule-of-three.

## The grab-during-window race (user's question, REASONED not measured)
Grabbing a prop DURING the reconcile window (before it snaps home) works host-authoritatively: the client
resolves the eid from its LOCAL mirror @save-pos, sends GrabIntent{eid}, the host enacts on its OWN prop
@host-pos; the reconcile then skips the now-grabbed prop (b3 skips clumps at :618; a rock's grab makes eid
DEAD). The prop is NOT ungrabbable. Only artifact = a visual jump. UNMEASURED — the probe must exercise it.

## MEASURE FIRST — the read-only probe (build this before ANY reconcile change)
A clean single-variable join (host moves ONE rock in-window, no hand/pile noise). Log, in tick order:
1. snapshot OnSpawn: host-pos APPLIED, or the `:418` DRIVE-SKIP fired? (discriminates loadObjects-clobber
   vs host-held-at-snapshot — the root is NOT confirmed until this separates them).
2. loadObjects recreate pos + the keyed RE-BIND eid + the final rendered pos.
3. grab-during-window order: host moves rock in-window, client grabs before the snap -> does eid resolve
   from the mirror @save-pos, does anything mis-snap?
4. host-holds-at-snap: is the host live-pos defined when the host still holds it?

Only after the probe: ratify/adjust the reconcile (piece 1), the send-side settled-skip, and the pile-only
apply-time settled-skip (piece 2). Provisional design above is a HYPOTHESIS, not AS-BUILT.

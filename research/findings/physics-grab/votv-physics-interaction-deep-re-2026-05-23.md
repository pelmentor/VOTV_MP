# VOTV physics-object interaction — deep reverse-engineering

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Game build:** Alpha 0.9.0-n (`VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe`, imagebase `0x140000000`)
**Trigger:** RULE 1 + "no infinite hopeless iteration cycles". The SDK-header UFunction guess for the grab observers proved wrong in hands-on test (commit `14d0787` debug build); this doc replaces it with ground truth from IDA decompile + runtime log diagnostic.

## TL;DR — the architecture, finally

```

The unknown wasn't "where is the BP", it was "**which** function does BP dispatch through ProcessEvent". The answer: **not the 8 SDK-header names** (smoothGrab, pickupObject, dropGrabObject, throwHoldingProp, switchToHeavyDrag, pickupObjectDirect, playerTryToGrab, canPickup — all of those are BP-pure inline functions and do **not** ProcessEvent-dispatch). The answer **is** the engine-native UPhysicsHandleComponent UFunctions, which are ProcessEvent-dispatched **and capture every grab/move/release universally** — light grab, heavy drag, doesn't matter.

## The log — empirical truth

Hands-on session 2026-05-23 22:40-22:43 with debug build `14d0787` (8 named observers + 4 name-prefix diagnostics: `pickup`, `grab`, `InpActEvt_use`, `holdObject`):

```
[22:40:00] grab_hook: registered POST observer for 'smoothGrab' @ 0000028715033260
[22:40:00] grab_hook: registered POST observer for 'pickupObject' @ 0000028715033420
[22:40:00] grab_hook: registered POST observer for 'pickupObjectDirect' @ 0000028715032FC0

(user picks up + drops + picks up + drops + picks up + drops a prop)

[22:41:07] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'InpActEvt_use_K2Node_InputActionEvent_41' self=0000028708079070
[22:41:07] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__UpdateFunc' self=0000028708079070
[22:41:08] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__UpdateFunc'  (×3)
[22:41:08] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__FinishedFunc'
[22:41:11] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__UpdateFunc'  (×5 across 22:41:11-12)

(quiet for ~1 minute)

[22:42:13] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__UpdateFunc'  (×9 across 22:42:13-15)

(quiet, then second E-press)

[22:43:09] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'InpActEvt_use_K2Node_InputActionEvent_41'
[22:43:17] grab_diag: dispatched UFunc 'grab__UpdateFunc'  (×9 across 22:43:17-21)
```

**Statistics:**
- All 8 SDK-header observers: **0 fires** in ~3 minutes of active grabbing.
- `InpActEvt_use_K2Node_InputActionEvent_41`: 2 fires (corresponding to 2 E-presses).
- `grab__UpdateFunc`: 27 fires (Timeline updates during grab animation).
- `grab__FinishedFunc`: 1 fire (Timeline end).
- Zero hits on the `pickup` prefix or `holdObject` prefix — confirming `pickupObject*` and `holdObject*` UFunctions never dispatch.

## Why the SDK-header functions don't dispatch

VOTV's mainPlayer_C BP graph defines functions like `smoothGrab`, `pickupObject`, etc. as **"Pure Functions"** (no exec pin). In Blueprint, pure functions are:
- Inlined at call sites by the BP compiler (`EX_CallMath`, `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` resolved inline)
- Re-evaluated every time any output is read
- **NOT dispatched through `UObject::ProcessEvent`**

UE4SS-style reflection iteration sees them in `UClass::Children` and they have valid UFunction pointers (which is why our `reflection::FindFunction` lookup succeeds), but they're **never the second argument to ProcessEvent**. Our hook is a ProcessEvent detour, so we never see them.

The exec UFunctions that **do** ProcessEvent-dispatch on mainPlayer_C BP:
- BP-event functions (`InpActEvt_*`, `BeginPlay`, `Tick`, anim notifies)
- Timeline auto-functions (`<TimelineName>__UpdateFunc`, `<TimelineName>__FinishedFunc`, `<TimelineName>__<EventTrackName>_Track`)
- Functions with exec pins (impure) bound via Custom Events or BP nodes that emit `EX_FinalFunction`/`EX_VirtualFunction` opcodes

## Native PhysicsHandle — full mapping

### Exec thunks (UFunction.Func pointers — what ProcessEvent's `function->Func` points at)

| Address | Renamed (IDB) | UE4 UFunction name (FName) | What it reads from FFrame |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x1430C64B0` | `execUPhysicsHandleComponent_GrabComponentAtLocation` | `GrabComponentAtLocation` | UPrimitiveComponent* comp, FName bone, FVector location |
| `0x1430C65D0` | `execUPhysicsHandleComponent_GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation` | `GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation` | + FRotator rotation |
| `0x1430C6AD0` | `execUPhysicsHandleComponent_SetTargetLocation` | `SetTargetLocation` | FVector targetLoc |
| `0x1430C6B60` | `execUPhysicsHandleComponent_SetTargetLocationAndRotation` | `SetTargetLocationAndRotation` | FVector targetLoc, FRotator targetRot |
| `0x142FEA9B0` | `execUPhysicsHandleComponent_ReleaseComponent` | `ReleaseComponent` | (no params) |

Each exec thunk reads its params from `FFrame` (the BP interpreter state), then tail-calls the native class method below.

### Class methods (native bodies)

| Address | Name | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `0x142D7A580` | `UPhysicsHandleComponent::GrabComponentAtLocation` | Thin forwarder → `vtable[1064/8=133]` PhysX-backend grab |
| `0x142D7A5B0` | `UPhysicsHandleComponent::GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation` | Same `vtable[133]` (unified backend; no-rot variant pre-fills identity quat in caller) |
| `0x142D7D3F0` | `UPhysicsHandleComponent::SetTargetLocation` | Writes `FVector` at `this+240` (TargetLocation). No PhysX work — read by TickComponent. |
| `0x142D7D420` | `UPhysicsHandleComponent::SetTargetLocationAndRotation` | Writes `FQuat` at `+224`, `FVector` at `+240`, derived transform at `+256` (from default-transform globals `0x14491FC38`/`0x14491FC40`) |
| (vtable[130], via thunk `0x142FEA9B0`) | `UPhysicsHandleComponent::ReleaseComponent` | PhysX constraint release; clears `GrabbedComponent` |

### Field offsets (UPhysicsHandleComponent) — FULLY MAPPED

| Offset | Type | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+176` (0xB0) | `UPrimitiveComponent*` | `GrabbedComponent` | Cleared by ReleaseComponent_Impl (PHC.cpp:336); set by GrabComponentImp |
| `+184` (0xB8) | `FName` (8B) | `GrabbedBoneName` | Set by GrabComponentImp; cleared by ReleaseComponent_Impl |
| `+192` (0xC0) | `uint32` | flags (`&=~1` = "bConstrained off") | ReleaseComponent_Impl |
| `+224` (0xE0) | `FQuat` (16B) | `TargetRotation` | SetTargetLocationAndRotation writes here |
| `+240` (0xF0) | `FVector` (12B+pad) | `TargetLocation` ← **per-tick driver** | SetTargetLocation writes here; UpdateHandleTransform reads it |
| `+256` (0x100) | derived transform | cached pose | SetTargetLocationAndRotation writes |
| `+328` (0x148) | `FPhysicsActorHandle*` | `KinActorData` | Destroyed by ReleaseComponent_Impl |
| `+336` (0x150) | `FPhysicsConstraintHandle*` | `ConstraintHandle` | Destroyed by ReleaseComponent_Impl; SetKinematicTarget called by UpdateHandleTransform |

All confirmed by IDA decompile of `ReleaseComponent_Impl` @0x142D7C670 (cites UE4 source PhysicsHandleComponent.cpp:336) and `UpdateHandleTransform` @0x142D7EE30 (cites PHC.cpp:413).

### Timeline pipeline (engine native)

| Address | Renamed (IDB) | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `0x142F1D9A0` | `UTimelineComponent_TickComponent` | Per-frame entry; stat-scopes, parents AActorComponent::TickComponent, calls FTimeline::TickTimeline |
| `0x142F1DEE0` | `FTimeline_TickTimeline` | Advances `Position` by `Rate*dt`; handles wrap (loop) and clamp (non-loop with FireFinishedEvent) |
| `0x142F1B550` | `FTimeline_TickTimelineEvents` | Fires bound update + event UFunctions via `OwningActor.ProcessEvent(fn, params)` |
| `0x142F10E00` | `FTimeline_FireFinishedEvent` | Fires bound finished UFunction once at end |

Timeline state struct (at `UTimelineComponent + 176`):
- `+0`: flags byte (`bit 0` = looping, `bit 1` = reversed, `bit 2` = playing, `bit 4` = idk)
- `+8`: `Rate` (float, play speed)
- `+12`: `Position` (float, playhead 0..Length)
- `+96`: FinishedFunc binding region (the FName-resolved UFunction* that `FireFinishedEvent` calls)
- `+128`: `OwningActor` pointer (the actor on which to ProcessEvent)
- `+136`: count of bound event funcs

## What this means for the coop mod

### The right hook surface

Hook the **engine-native** UPhysicsHandleComponent UFunctions, not VOTV's BP-pure helpers:

| UFunction | When fires | What we learn |
|---|---|---|
| `PhysicsHandleComponent.GrabComponentAtLocation` | Light-grab starts (Timeline's UpdateFunc first calls it OR a one-shot setup) | which UPrimitiveComponent was grabbed + initial location |
| `PhysicsHandleComponent.GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation` | Same as above but if BP supplies a rotation | + rotation |
| `PhysicsHandleComponent.SetTargetLocation` | **Every tick** during light grab | per-tick target FVector — the held-prop drive signal |
| `PhysicsHandleComponent.SetTargetLocationAndRotation` | Every tick if heavy drag uses the with-rot variant | + rotation |
| `PhysicsHandleComponent.ReleaseComponent` | Grab ends (drop or throw) | nothing useful in params, but signals end |

This is **universal** — it captures both light grab AND heavy drag (they both go through the same PhysicsHandle component). It avoids guessing which VOTV-specific BP function will be the entry point.

### Pass-2 RE findings (this session) — RESOLVED

1. ~~**GrabbedComponent offset**~~ → **+176** (this session, via IDA decompile).
2. ~~**Which UPhysicsHandleComponent is `grabHandle`**~~ → `mainPlayer_C.grabHandle` @ **+0x0688** (SDK dump mainPlayer.hpp:63).
3. **Heavy drag uses a SEPARATE component** — `mainPlayer_C.heavyGrab` @ **+0x04F0** is a `UPhysicsConstraintComponent*` (NOT UPhysicsHandleComponent). SDK dump mainPlayer.hpp:12. Our 5 PHC observers MISS heavy drag entirely; need separate UPhysicsConstraintComponent observers (`SetConstrainedComponents` for setup, `BreakConstraint` for release). These ARE ProcessEvent-dispatched (engine UFunctions).
4. **Throw path** — still TBD. `throwHoldingProp` is BP-pure (proven). The throw likely calls `ReleaseComponent` + `UPrimitiveComponent::AddImpulse`. We'd capture step 1 via our existing observer; AddImpulse is also a ProcessEvent-dispatchable engine UFunction.

### Still open

1. **Throw impulse path** — observe `UPrimitiveComponent::AddImpulse` to confirm throw mechanics.
2. **dropGrabObject mechanism** — does it just call `grab__FinishedFunc` (Timeline reverse) or call ReleaseComponent directly? Hands-on retest will clarify.
3. **Drop a small prop vs throw a small prop** — does throw produce DIFFERENT observable activity than drop (e.g. AddImpulse)?

### Autonomous test results (run 1 — pre-throttle-fix)

First run of `lan-test.ps1 -GrabTest` (host nick=Host, autotest pose at КПП):

```
grab_test: VOTVCOOP_RUN_GRAB_TEST=1 (host) -- spawning grab test thread
grab_test: starting autonomous grab routine (waiting 10 s for stabilization)
grab_test: resolve OK  player=0x150475B40C0  grabHandle=0x150505C1780
           propBase=0x1505E486D00 grabFn=0x150263C76A0 frame=32 (Comp@0 Bone@8 Loc@16)
           setTargetFn=0x150263CA960 frame=12 (Loc@0)  releaseFn=0x150263C74E0
grab_test: prop scan scanned=237576 candidates=2060
           nearest=0x1513B39C940 (prop_container_suitcase_C) dist=85.4
           mesh=0x1513B4C60A0
grab_test: teleported prop -> (-37677.8, 69824.8, 6469.7)
grab_hook[PHC.Grab]: handle=0x150505C1780 (pickup -- light grab path)      <-- observer fired
grab_test: CallFunction(GrabComponentAtLocation) -> 1
grab_test: now driving SetTargetLocation 5x (1 sec apart)
grab_test: tick 0 SetTargetLocation((-37677.8,69824.8,6469.7)) -> 1
grab_test: tick 1 SetTargetLocation((-37677.8,69824.8,6474.7)) -> 1
grab_test: tick 2 SetTargetLocation((-37677.8,69824.8,6479.7)) -> 1
grab_test: tick 3 SetTargetLocation((-37677.8,69824.8,6484.7)) -> 1
grab_test: tick 4 SetTargetLocation((-37677.8,69824.8,6489.7)) -> 1
grab_hook[PHC.Release PRE]: handle=0x150505C1780 released_component=0x1513B4C60A0  <-- observer fired
grab_test: CallFunction(ReleaseComponent) -> 1
grab_test: DONE -- autonomous grab routine complete
```

**What this proves:**

1. **Engine-native PhysicsHandle UFunctions ARE ProcessEvent-dispatched.** `reflection::CallFunction(grabHandle, GrabFn, frame)` → our `ProcessEventDetour` observed it → `GrabObserver_PHC_Grab` ran. This validates the hook surface choice for ALL future grab observation (including hands-on user E-press).

2. **GrabbedComponent offset @+176 is correct.** The `released_component` we read from `handle+176` in the Release-PRE observer (`0x1513B4C60A0`) matches the `mesh` pointer we wrote into the GrabComponentAtLocation param frame from the prop's `StaticMesh` field (`0x1513B4C60A0`). Round-trip verified.

3. **Super-chain walk works.** Out of 237,576 UObjects, 2,060 derive from `Aprop_C` — the player spawn point at КПП has 2,060+ physics props in scene. Selected nearest = `prop_container_suitcase_C` (literally "baggage" as the user described) at 85.4 cm.

4. **UFunction param marshaling works for FName + UPrimitiveComponent\* + FVector.** `GrabComponentAtLocation` takes `(comp@0, bone@8, location@16)` in a 32-byte frame, all written via reflected param offsets; CallFunction returned 1 (success).

5. **CallFunction handles zero-param functions.** `ReleaseComponent` (no params, nullptr frame) — CallFunction returned 1, observer fired.

6. **SetTargetLocation observer was suppressed by 1-in-30 throttle.** Only 5 calls made → no log lines. Fixed in next iteration (log first 3 + every 30th).

### Stage-4 architecture finding: FName.ComparisonIndex is NOT cross-peer stable

The earlier hypothesis ("Aprop_C.Key.ComparisonIndex is our 32-bit cross-peer
prop ID") **is wrong**. Evidence from runs 2/3/4 of the autonomous grab test:

| Run | Process | Prop FName string         | ComparisonIndex |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | host   | `Xym5dmnBEzreWaHSkQ9Tew` |  2452225 |
| 3 | host   | `Xym5dmnBEzreWaHSkQ9Tew` |  2452211 |
| 4 | host   | `Xym5dmnBEzreWaHSkQ9Tew` |  2452211 |
| 4 | client | `Q8q9QNQtluxuzLPrp7dvgQ` |  2499115 |

The Key STRING is stable (it's the save-system UUID baked into the .sav file
+ FName pool of cooked content). The ComparisonIndex is **per-process** — UE4
builds the FName name-pool incrementally as objects load, so the idx depends
on load order, not on string identity.

**Wire serialization for Stage 4 MUST transmit the Key STRING**, not the idx:

* Reliable GRAB/RELEASE packet: send `uint8 length + utf8 bytes` (22 chars
  typical for the UUID-style keys = 23 bytes overhead per packet). Receiver
  resolves to its local UFunction* / Aprop_C* by walking GUObjectArray and
  matching `ToString(Key) == sent_string` (one-shot at grab start; cache the
  resolved pointer for the grab duration).
* Unreliable POSE piggyback: cache the pointer client-side after GRAB; pose
  packet only needs a small handle (e.g. 8-bit slot id into a fixed-size
  active-grabs table). Or skip the prop pointer entirely from the pose
  packet and let the receiver look up the prop from the LAST GRAB packet.

Caveat: the cross-peer test (run 4) showed host and client picked DIFFERENT
nearest props because their autotest spawn poses are ~14 m apart. To
*directly* verify "same prop string both peers" we'd pick a prop by a
known anchor (class + nearest to fixed world coord) on both peers and
compare. The string stability is high-confidence regardless because the
strings come from the save UUID which both peers load identically.

### Autonomous test (NEW — this session)

A new harness function `RunAutonomousGrabTest()` exercises the FULL Stage-1 observer pipeline end-to-end **without a user E-press**:

1. Find local `mainPlayer_C`
2. Read its `grabHandle` (+0x0688)
3. Walk GUObjectArray, super-chain-walk to find all `Aprop_C` derivatives, pick nearest
4. Teleport that prop to the player's hand (camera + forward × 80 cm)
5. Reflection-call `grabHandle.GrabComponentAtLocation(propMesh, NAME_None, handPos)`
6. Per-second × 5: reflection-call `grabHandle.SetTargetLocation(newPos)`
7. Reflection-call `grabHandle.ReleaseComponent()`

Each step expects matching `grab_hook[PHC.*]` log lines proving the observer pipeline is live.

Gated by env `VOTVCOOP_RUN_GRAB_TEST=1` (host only). Runs from a worker thread; all engine work goes through `GT::Post` for game-thread safety. Wired into `lan-test.ps1 -GrabTest` for one-command CI-style execution.

**Why this matters:** previously, observer firing could ONLY be verified hands-on (user pressed E on a real prop). Now we can verify end-to-end on any code change. The grab UFunctions called via `reflection::CallFunction` route through the same `UObject::ProcessEvent` our detour observes, so the path is functionally identical to a real BP-driven grab.

### Receiver-side strategy (unchanged)

Same as before, MTA-shape:
1. `SetSimulatePhysics(false)` on the prop on remotes (prop now kinematic).
2. Stream prop world transform from grabber → other peers via UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED piggyback packet.
3. `SetActorLocation`/`SetActorRotation` on remotes each packet.
4. `SetSimulatePhysics(true)` on release; if `throwHoldingProp` sent a velocity, `AddImpulse`.

The hook surface change doesn't affect the wire protocol or receiver — only the trigger point on the host. The host **reads** the grabbed prop from `mainPlayer_C.grabbing_actor` after the first `SetTargetLocation`/`GrabComponentAtLocation` observer fires, and **drives** the prop sync packet from there.

## Code changes triggered by this finding

### Drop (RULE 2 — no migration baggage)

The 8 SDK-header observers in `harness.cpp` and the 6 UFunction-name constants in `sdk_profile.h` (`smoothGrabFn`, `pickupObjectFn`, `pickupObjectDirectFn`, `dropGrabObjectFn`, `throwHoldingPropFn`, `switchToHeavyDragFn`) — all proven non-dispatching, all dead code. Delete.

`playerTryToGrab` and `canPickup` — also BP-pure (none dispatched). Delete.

### Add

In `sdk_profile.h`:
```cpp
constexpr const wchar_t* PhysicsHandleClass = L"PhysicsHandleComponent";
constexpr const wchar_t* GrabComponentAtLocationFn = L"GrabComponentAtLocation";
constexpr const wchar_t* GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotationFn = L"GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation";
constexpr const wchar_t* SetTargetLocationFn = L"SetTargetLocation";
constexpr const wchar_t* SetTargetLocationAndRotationFn = L"SetTargetLocationAndRotation";
constexpr const wchar_t* ReleaseComponentFn = L"ReleaseComponent";

// Timeline-driven grab on mainPlayer_C BP
constexpr const wchar_t* MainPlayerGrabUpdateFn = L"grab__UpdateFunc";
constexpr const wchar_t* MainPlayerGrabFinishedFn = L"grab__FinishedFunc";

// Input event for E (use)
constexpr const wchar_t* MainPlayerUseInputEventFn = L"InpActEvt_use_K2Node_InputActionEvent_41";
```

In `harness.cpp`, register observers in this order of preference:

**Primary (universal, captures any physics-handle grab):**
1. `PhysicsHandleComponent.GrabComponentAtLocation` (post) — pickup
2. `PhysicsHandleComponent.GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation` (post) — pickup w/ rot
3. `PhysicsHandleComponent.SetTargetLocation` (post) — per-tick target update
4. `PhysicsHandleComponent.SetTargetLocationAndRotation` (post) — per-tick w/ rot
5. `PhysicsHandleComponent.ReleaseComponent` (pre) — release (read state before clear)

**Secondary (BP-Timeline level — informational / triangulates with primary):**
6. `mainPlayer_C.grab__UpdateFunc` (post) — confirms Timeline tick
7. `mainPlayer_C.grab__FinishedFunc` (pre) — confirms Timeline end
8. `mainPlayer_C.InpActEvt_use_K2Node_InputActionEvent_41` (post) — confirms E press

### Retire the diagnostic mode (RULE 2)

The name-prefix diagnostic served its purpose. Strip after the new observers are confirmed firing in hands-on retest.

## Stage 1 next iteration

1. Drop the 8 SDK-header observers + delete the 6 UFunction-name constants (RULE 2).
2. Add the 5 PhysicsHandle observers + 3 mainPlayer_C observers (primary + secondary).
3. Keep diagnostic temporarily, add `SetTargetLocation` prefix to detect heavy-drag path coverage.
4. Build, deploy, hands-on retest: pick up small prop (light grab), drag heavy desk (heavy drag), throw small prop. Confirm:
   - `SetTargetLocation` fires per tick during light grab → host captures held prop
   - `GrabComponentAtLocation` fires once at pickup
   - `ReleaseComponent` fires once at release
   - Whether heavy drag also goes through `SetTargetLocation` or a different path
5. Once primary observers confirmed firing, retire diagnostic + Timeline secondary observers (or keep one as fallback diagnostic).

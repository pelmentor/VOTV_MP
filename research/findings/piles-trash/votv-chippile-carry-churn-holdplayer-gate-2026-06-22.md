# chipPile carry — the CONTACT-RE-PILE CHURN root + the CLOSE-B carry-latch fix

**Pre-take-30 status (historical — superseded by the FINAL STATE above):** carry-FREEZE [V] + carry-JANK [V]
fixed; SCALE/throw-ARC/level-pile-DESTROY were then BUILT-pending or NOT-built. Arc of dead ends (don't retry):
option 1 (hit-notify) BUILT+FAILED; option 2 (holdPlayer gate) DISPROVEN by bytecode; `carrying &&
HasPendingSettle` gate (`C9F28176`) BUILT+FAILED (the flicker is `updateHold` puppet recreation); the
`key.len=4` key-first jank theory DISPROVEN; the `simulateDrop`/`dropGrabObject` release-verb flip DEAD (0
fires). Filename keeps `holdplayer-gate` for link stability; that gate is the DISPROVEN option 2, not the fix.
Supersedes the false "carry MIRRORS on a settled join / JOIN RACE" conclusion in
`votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`.

This is the canonical doc for *why the host-carry of a chipPile clump does not mirror cleanly on the client*
and the fix that is queued. Read it before touching trash carry / the re-pile thunk / `OnHostConvert`.

---

## The symptom (user hands-on, build `8bc797ef`, take-24+)

- **Host:** carries the clump perfectly — native, clean, piles vanish, all good. (User: "all interactions
  on host are local so they're all good and native.")
- **Other physics props:** grab + carry + throw mirror **perfectly** on the client (pure pose-stream + lerp).
- **ONLY the chipPile/clump mirror is broken on the client:** the carried clump's movement + morphs run at
  ~**0.5–2 fps** (NOT the client's frame rate — the game runs 120 fps; the *interaction mirror* is choppy),
  and an **old pile does not disappear** at the rest spot. (Two possibly-distinct client symptoms; the
  lag is the churn, the non-disappearing pile is the proxy/orphan — keep them separate until proven common.)

So the host simulation is correct; the bug is **entirely in the host→client mirror path, and only for the
clump**, because the clump is the **only** entity mirrored through the **convert machine** (PropConvert
pile↔clump) instead of the plain pose-stream every other prop rides.

## The root — a CONTACT-RE-PILE CHURN (RE-confirmed bytecode + host log)

The held clump **re-piles on contact with the pile cluster ~once a second**, and the game **auto-re-grabs**
it, producing a churn the client faithfully renders as a teleport per convert.

**The re-pile trigger (votv-clump-ball-to-pile-conversion-RE-2026-06-08.md, bytecode):** the clump converts
to a pile on its **`StaticMesh.OnComponentHit`** delegate → `ExecuteUbergraph_prop_garbageClump(@2702)`. The
convert gate (@2874–@3573):
```
@2884  IsValid(holdPlayer)?               no → CONVERT
@2927  IsValid(holdPlayer.grabbing_actor)? no → CONVERT  : yes → ABORT (still held)
@3242  Dot(HitNormal, Up) > 0.75 ?        no → abort   (slope: near-flat only)
@3462  IsSimulatingPhysics(HitComp)?      yes → abort   (static surface only)
@3536  StaticMesh.SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false) ; @3573 Delay(0) → SPAWN pile
```
**The "still held" abort (@2927) gates on `holdPlayer.grabbing_actor`.** But a real **E-press** grab carries
the clump in **`holding_actor`** (the chipPile morph slot), so `grabbing_actor` is **null** → the gate
**never fires** → **the clump re-piles on every flat-static contact while you carry it.** In a pile cluster
the held clump touches neighbours/ground constantly → re-pile ~1/s. This is **stock VOTV behaviour** (SP does
it too; the user's "SP is fine" was open-space, no contact). The game then auto-re-grabs the re-piled pile
(grab-toggle still on) → a NEW clump → churn. Host log (`8bc797ef`, 09:45): `GRAB → RE-PILE(thunk) → LAND →
GRAB → RE-PILE → LAND …`, a *new* clump actor + a *new* chipPile actor each cycle (real engine pointers).

**Why the host looks flawless but the log churns:** the re-pile + auto-re-grab is instant, so the user sees a
solid clump; underneath it churns. Both "host flawless" and "re-pile every second" are true simultaneously.

**Why the client lags:** each PropConvert (`OnHostConvert`) on the client does `ClearAnyDriveFor(proxy)` +
`SetActorLocation(proxy, …)` — a **hard teleport that kills the lerp** (`remote_prop.cpp:1148`). A normal prop
**never converts** (pure pose-stream → snap-per-pose at ~60 Hz = smooth). The clump converts ~2×/s and
teleports each time → the 0.5–2 fps "morphs."

## Why the smoke LIED ("carry proven on a settled join" was FALSE)

`autotest_chippile.cpp` grabs by calling **`playerGrabbed` directly** → the clump lands in **`grabbing_actor`**
(the PHC path). With `grabbing_actor` valid, the native re-pile gate **aborts** (@2927) → the autotest clump
**never re-piles while held** → no churn → the smoke's `drive #1..#540` clean carry. A **real E-press** uses
**`holding_actor`** → churns. So the two clean smokes (`b97z33gyh`/`b7oxr23uy`) proved a grab path the user
never takes. The render-blind smoke + the wrong grab slot = the false "carry MIRRORS on a settled join."
**Lesson:** an autotest that grabs via `playerGrabbed` is NOT representative of a real E-press grab — the
carry slot (grabbing_actor vs holding_actor) differs, and that slot decides whether the clump re-piles.

## Option 1 — suppress the re-pile on the host clump — BUILT + FAILED

Built (`8bc797ef`, uncommitted in `local_streams.cpp`): on the grab edge,
`engine::SetActorRootNotifyRigidBodyCollision(heldClump, false)` (the game's own "stop further hits"
mechanism, @3536); re-enable on release. **Hands-on FAILED — the churn persisted** (host log still shows
`RE-PILE(thunk)` ~1/s). **Why:** the **host clump is LIVE** — its own BP re-arms hit-notify after our disable
(our *mirror* clump stays inert only because its BP never runs). Disabling the live actor's hit-notify
**fights the live graph and loses.** Making the native gate "see held" by writing the player's
`grabbing_actor` is risky (it's the PHC slot) and would change stock host behaviour. **Option 1 is the wrong
layer.** REVERT it.

## Option 2 (`holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate) — DISPROVEN by the bytecode (2026-06-22)

The queued `holdPlayer`-keyed gate is DEAD. `prop_garbageClump_C::holdPlayer` (`@0x0240`) is written
**once**, on grab, by the PILE: `actorChipPile` `turnToPile`/`playerGrabbed` does
`SetObjectPropertyByName(newClump, "holdPlayer", grabbingPlayer)` right AFTER
`BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` (`bp_reflection/actorChipPile.json` @8492). It is **NEVER cleared** in
any blueprint — grep across `prop_garbageClump` / `actorChipPile` / `mainPlayer`: the clump only READS it in
the re-pile gate (@2884 `IsValid(holdPlayer)`, @2927 `IsValid(holdPlayer.grabbing_actor)`); `mainPlayer`
never references it. So on a REAL drop `holdPlayer` stays non-null until the clump self-destructs — the
native gate distinguishes "still actively held" via `holdPlayer.grabbing_actor` (the PHC slot, **null during
an E-press carry** — the churn root), NOT via `holdPlayer` itself. A convert gate keyed on
`holdPlayer != null` would therefore SUPPRESS the real land (holdPlayer still set) → the clump stuck a clump
forever client-side. The user predicted this exact hole ("is holdPlayer cleared before the land thunk?");
the bytecode says no. **Disproven — do not build it.** (Also disproven en route: `holding_actor` is the
weapon-attached equipment PUPPET that `updateHold` destroys+respawns — `updateHold[32/33/52/53]`,
collision-off — and whether the chipPile clump even uses it is unresolvable from BP; so no `holding_actor`-
timing gate either. `holdObjectChanged_pre/post` ARE broadcast, in `updateHold` — but they fire in the churn
too, so not churn-silent.)

## THE FIX — CLOSE-B: a host-side carry latch + land-settle on the convert stream (DESIGN LOCKED, 2026-06-22)

Resolved by proof, not the murky `holding_actor` timing: gate the convert STREAM the host already observes,
with a per-eid latch closed by a settle. Foundations all bytecode-proven: the re-pile thunk
(`OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve`, clump→pile ONLY — `trash_collect_sync.cpp:76`) + the per-eid ctx map.

**The churn as the host's plumbing sees it (the refinement that explains BOTH client symptoms):** the thunk
catches ONLY the re-pile (kToPile); the churn RE-GRAB (pile→clump) is caught by neither the thunk (it filters
`srcObj=clump`) nor the held-edge (no pending grab). So pre-fix the host broadcasts a stream of **kToPile
only** → the client re-skins to PILE every churn cycle and never back → the single eid-E proxy sticks as a
pile at the cluster, teleported + drive-cleared each cycle (`remote_prop.cpp:1148-1152`). That IS both the
0.5–2 fps AND the "old pile doesn't disappear" — ONE root, not two bugs.

**CLOSE-B (host-side, in `trash_channel`):**
- **OPEN** — `OnHostConvert(kToClump)` while not carrying (the real grab, via `AdoptPendingGrabClump`):
  broadcast the one ToClump, `carrying[E]=true`.
- **Suppress churn re-pile** — `OnHostConvert(kToPile)` while carrying: do NOT broadcast, do NOT bump ctx;
  `RebindE(E, pile)` locally (track the live actor); start/refresh a land-settle (capture loc/rot/chipType/
  class, countdown K).
- **Rebind churn re-grab** — `OnHostRegrab(E, newClump)` from the held-edge (a new held clump during carry,
  no pending grab): `RebindE(E, clump)` + CANCEL the settle (a re-grab proves the preceding re-pile was
  churn). Keeps the carry pose-stream alive across the churn (today the binding is LOST here → the freeze).
- **CLOSE** — the settle reaches 0 with no re-grab: broadcast the held ToPile (the ONE real land), bump ctx,
  `carrying[E]=false`.
- **SAFETY** — v1: `OnDisconnect` clears all (`ForgetEid` also exists for an explicit retire). A stuck latch
  on a dead, never-reused eid is benign (no future convert comes for it; the client's phantom clump is cleaned
  by the existing PropDestroy when E's actor dies). The on-DESTROY `ForgetEid` hook is **v2** — it must NOT
  hang off the generic `K2_DestroyActor` PRE (that fires on every churn re-pile clump-destroy → would
  false-close mid-churn); it needs the guard that a churn re-pile resolves `eid=0` there (E rebinds to the
  pile first), confirmed from the smoke. A quiet-carry-SAFE watchdog is also v2 (a tick "no-activity" timeout
  would false-close a long km carry far from any cluster — converts≠liveness).

K starts at **6 ticks** (> a synchronous re-grab); the first smoke logs the real ToPile→ToClump gap
(`[TRASH-CH] … CANCEL eid=… gap=N`) to tune it. **Graceful (K non-critical, not a race):** K too small → a
churn ToPile commits early, the re-grab re-opens → brief self-correcting `clump→pile→clump` flicker; K too
large → a few frames' land-morph lag. NEITHER strands E. The settle is a host-side hold-then-commit on an
idempotent, ctx-ordered convert — it races nothing.

## AS-BUILT (2026-06-22, hands-on-iterated)
- **`65AD883A`** — CLOSE-B v1: the carry latch + land-settle + `OnHostRegrab` + `TickCarry` + `ForgetEid`
  (`trash_channel.{h,cpp}`) + the held-edge re-grab rebind (`local_streams.cpp`) + `TickCarry(session)`
  (`subsystems.cpp:363`). **Hands-on:** opened the latch + suppressed the churn (no stuck pile ✓), drop→pile
  fast ✓, BUT the carry was **frozen between E-events** (the release-flicker, below). The dup (old-pile +
  new-clump on grab) showed once = a separate intermittent eid-mismatch (`fwdEid` vs the client's mirror eid),
  NOT the churn — dormant, not fixed.
- **`C9F28176` (committed `16ac153f`) — the `carrying && HasPendingSettle` gate — BUILT + FAILED hands-on.**
  Theory: suppress the release edge only on a churn re-pile (which starts a land-settle). WRONG MODEL: the
  release-edge flicker is NOT a chipPile re-pile — it's `updateHold` RECREATING the held puppet (`heldActor`
  ptr changes, `pendingSettle=0`), so `HasPendingSettle` structurally never caught it. User: "still frozen
  between E." SUPERSEDED.
- **`448565A5` — read-only diagnostic** (`[HELD-STATE]`/`[REL-EDGE]`/`[POSE-SKIP]`/`[SIM-DROP]` logs). PROVED
  the carry data path is WHOLE (host emits 60 fps → client drives the eid proxy → a Movable actor) and that
  the freeze = the spurious FIRE (`carrying=1 pendingSettle=0`) → ctx churn → client holds carry poses.
- **`EE0DD83C` — `!carrying` gate — the CARRY-FREEZE FIX, hands-on VERIFIED [V].** The release edge now
  suppresses the WHOLE carry (`local_streams.cpp` `else if (g_lastHeldProp && !IsCarrying(g_lastHeldEid))`);
  the latch closes via the land-settle (drop), and — after a future FLIP — via the `simulateDrop` thunk
  (below). **User hands-on: the freeze is GONE, the clump UPDATES through the carry.** No `R::IsLive`, no
  `HasPendingSettle` (kept only for the diag log).

## Post-`!carrying` open issues (hands-on EE0DD83C, all root-found from log+code)
1. **JANK — root CORRECTED, then BUILT (`f82943bcd7560724`, v83, hands-on PENDING).**
   - **The first theory was WRONG (disproven by bytecode + log + the receiver guard).** It was: the clump
     pose streams `key.len=4` → key-first mis-route → no drive. But (a) the BP `GetKey` for BOTH
     `prop_garbageClump_C` AND `actorChipPile_C` returns the FName literal **`"None"`** UNCONDITIONALLY
     (`docs/piles/re-artifacts/bp_reflection/prop_garbageClump.json:19625`, `actorChipPile.json:41480`) — so
     `key.len=4` is literally the **string** `"None"` (`ToString(FName_None)`), not a real key, and it is
     FIXED, never per-instance. (b) The receiver ALREADY guards it: `if (!keyW.empty() && keyW != L"None")`
     (`remote_prop.cpp:403`) → for `"None"` this is false → it skips `ResolveLiveActorByKey` and falls to the
     eid. Forcing `pp.key.len=0` produces the IDENTICAL routing — a **no-op** for the jank. (c) The
     `EE0DD83C` client log proved it: **15 `drive #` lines at a clean 60/s**, eid-resolved proxy, ONE ctx
     HOLD, ZERO `no local match` — the proxy WAS being driven. "Zero drive" was wrong too.
   - **The REAL root (code-PROVEN):** an interpolation **phase-stall**. `remote_prop::Tick` calls
     `BeginLerpToPose` (set `lerpStartMs = nowMs`) then `AdvanceLerp` **in the same tick** with the **same**
     `nowMs` → `alpha = (nowMs - lerpStartMs)/dur = 0` → renders the start pos, ZERO movement on every
     new-pose tick. At vsync-60 (pose rate ≈ tick rate) almost every tick is a new-pose tick → the proxy
     barely advances, lurching on the rare pose-free tick = the jank. Classic netcode error (reset the interp
     clock to "now", then sample at "now"); the interp added "for smoothness" was WORSE than the non-proxy
     snap-to-latest.
   - **FIX (BUILT, RULE-1, MTA-aligned):** fixed-delay snapshot interpolation. `ActiveDrive` now buffers the
     two most recent timestamped poses (`prevLoc/prevPoseMs`, `lastLoc/lastPoseMs`); `AdvanceLerp` renders at
     `nowMs - span` BEHIND the newest (span = the measured inter-pose interval, clamped [16,200]ms ≈ one frame
     at 60fps), `alpha` by REAL timestamps. The render clock advances EVERY tick independent of pose arrival →
     smooth at any frame rate; on a stream gap `alpha` clamps to 1 → reach last + FREEZE (no extrapolation).
     `reference/mtasa-blue` CClientVehicle::UpdateTargetPosition shape. Both audits (perf + correctness) PASS
     clean. (`remote_prop.cpp` `ActiveDrive`/`BeginLerpToPose`/`AdvanceLerp`/`ResetDriveState`.)
2. **SCALE — claim CORRECTED, then BUILT (v83, hands-on PENDING).** The proxy looked SMALLER. The prior claim
   "`PropConvertPayload` HAS `scaleX/Y/Z` (`protocol.h:2208`)" was **WRONG** — that line is `PropSpawnPayload`;
   `PropConvertPayload` had **NO** scale fields. **FIX (proto v82→v83):** added `scaleX/Y/Z` to
   `PropConvertPayload` (`static_assert` 100→112); `BroadcastConvert` sends the host's real
   `GetActorScale3D(newActor)` PER FORM (clump vs pile differ); the proxy applies it via new
   `ue_wrap::engine::SetActorScale3D` (no setter existed) in `SpawnProxy` (fresh) + `ReskinProxy` (every
   convert), guarded `>0.001` (rejects zero AND NaN). Covers carry converts + join-placed piles. (User's
   size-marker: with scale fixed, smaller-vs-normal no longer distinguishes proxy from orphan → a dup is now
   unambiguously the `isProxy=0` orphan — issue 3.)
3. **ORPHAN dup — SPLIT by pile ORIGIN (root CONFIRMED; the eid-race theory SUPERSEDED).** Hands-on: the dup
   is GONE for **DERIVED** (gameplay-born) piles [V] but PERSISTS for **ORIGINAL** (level-placed) piles. Agent
   trace (code+log) confirmed the root: a level-placed chipPile DOES get an eid + a proxy (the eidOnly snapshot
   lane, `prop_snapshot.cpp:262`; the eid is shared both sides — host grab resolves the SAME eid the client
   proxy has), so the prior "no eid / eid-resolve race / `isProxy=0` spawn-fresh" theory is **WRONG**. The real
   root: the client's **NATIVE level-loaded chipPile is NEVER reconciled away** — it COEXISTS with the proxy
   the host expresses on top (~871 native + 870 proxy ≈ 1741 actors for ~870 logical piles, client log
   `:10806` + 870 `trash_proxy: SPAWN`). The grab-convert correctly re-skins the PROXY (every convert
   `isProxy=1`), but the native sits untouched = the visible dup. The divergence sweep is BLIND to natives (it
   walks the element Registry, `remote_prop_spawn.cpp:1044`; native level-piles enter it only lazily). Derived
   piles never had a native twin (born only as a host convert → a proxy both sides) → no dup. **FIX (NEXT pass,
   NOT built): DESTROY the native at proxy-spawn** — NOT adopt (adopt = use the native BP as the mirror, which
   reintroduces the BP self-morph/GC/local-grab the proxy model exists to AVOID — the superseded approach).
   EXACT position-match (~1cm; deterministic save load; a 5cm radius would grab a cluster neighbour); graceful
   on 0, exact-or-skip on >1; a join-time position index built ONCE before the proxy-spawns (O(1) lookup). A
   **read-only PILE-PROBE shipped (`29069f05`, `remote_prop_spawn.cpp:355`)** logs `[PILE-PROBE] ... native
   actorChipPile within 1cm=N 10cm=M` (expect 1 for level, 0 for derived) to confirm the coexistence + the
   match precision before the destroy is built.
4. **The throw-velocity VERB-FLIP is DEAD — REPLACED by carry/flight stream-CONTINUITY (`136ed779`, deployed,
   hands-on PENDING).** Both candidate verbs fired ZERO times: `simulateDrop` (`SIM-DROP=0`) AND its
   RE-pinned successor `dropGrabObject` (`DROP-GRAB=0`), across 7 grab/release cycles, while the same
   `UFunction::Func` facility (the BeginDeferred re-pile thunk, slot 0) fired all run. So the chipPile clump
   release goes through **neither** verb (`simulateDrop` = the EQUIPMENT/`holding_actor` drop; the clump rides
   `grabbing_actor` = the physics-handle PHC grab; `dropGrabObject` IS the PHC release verb per RE
   `mainPlayer.json:167013`+`:167059` but STILL never fired for the clump). The throws confirmed the cost:
   `|v|=0.0` (the land-settle closes the latch only AFTER the clump re-piled/died). **PIVOT (the elegant one):
   the arc needs NO verb, NO velocity, NO flip.** The host's thrown clump really FLIES (physics) until it
   re-piles, so the carry pose-stream just CONTINUES through the release: `local_streams.cpp` — the
   release-edge `!carrying`-SKIP branch now streams `g_lastHeldProp`'s pose under the SAME eid E while it is a
   LIVE `garbageClump`; the client's fixed-delay interp shows the REAL arc; it ends when the clump re-piles
   (the re-pile thunk's ToPile re-skins+snaps the proxy). The churn/flight discriminator is **`IsLive`** — a
   churn re-pile DESTROYS the clump (skip the gap), a real release leaves it ALIVE+flying (stream the arc) —
   the verb we never needed. The carry main branch (`heldActor`-keyed) is byte-identical (additive; audit
   zero-CRITICAL). The dead `dropGrabObject` read-only thunk is to be retired (RULE 2) in the verify build.

## NEXT (SUPERSEDED — see the FINAL STATE block at the top; this section is the take-29 point-in-time plan, now mostly DONE)
1. **USER HANDS-ON (take-29, `research/handson_runbook_2026-06-22_throw_arc_probe.md`).** Deployed all 4 copies
   (`c2a5f49cc98add31`, MATCH x4). Acceptance: (1) **the throw FLIES AN ARC** on the client (the carry/flight
   stream-continuity — the MAIN check; host log `[PILE] HOST carry/flight CONTINUE`); (2) carry stayed SMOOTH
   (the main branch is byte-identical — must not regress); (3) clean LANDING (clump morphs to a pile at the
   authoritative spot, no hang, no double-pile at the arc's end); (4) **PILE-PROBE numbers** — client log
   `[PILE-PROBE] ... within 1cm=N 10cm=M` (expect **1cm=1** for level piles = the coexisting native, **0** for
   derived; 1cm=1 ⇒ bit-exact load ⇒ the tight match is cluster-safe).
2. **LEVEL-PILE DESTROY-FIX (the dup, NEXT BUILD — gated on the probe numbers).** Per the PROBE: build the
   join-time chipPile position index (once, before the proxy-spawns), then at a pile proxy-spawn DESTROY the
   co-located native (`remote_prop_spawn.cpp:355` trash branch) — exact ~1cm match, graceful on 0,
   exact-or-skip on >1, NOT "nearest in a radius" (cluster-safe). NOT adopt (adopt reintroduces the BP
   self-morph the proxy model avoids). Reuse the existing `g_pileBindIndex` machinery.
3. **Throw verify → then retire the dead `dropGrabObject` thunk (RULE 2)** + suppress the now-redundant
   `PropRelease` for a trash proxy (the flight-stream + ToPile already handle the throw; the `|v|=0` release is
   dead weight). The `simulateDrop`/`dropGrabObject` VERB approach is fully abandoned — do NOT retry it.
4. **SCALE (#3a) recheck** — the user did not eyeball the proxy size this run; confirm host-sized on the next.
5. **Modular debt (audit flag):** `remote_prop.cpp` (1362 LOC) + `remote_prop_spawn.cpp` (1341) past the 800
   soft cap (under 1500 hard). Extract the interpolation engine
   (`ActiveDrive`/`BeginLerpToPose`/`AdvanceLerp`/`LerpAngle`/the lerp constants, ~120 LOC) →
   `coop/prop_interp.{cpp,h}` at the next feature touch of remote_prop.cpp.
6. v3: the quiet-carry-safe host watchdog + the on-destroy `ForgetEid` hook (guarded so a churn re-pile's
   `eid=0` destroy doesn't false-close); then the grab-via-thunk tightening (retire the InpActEvt-PRE adopt — RULE 2).

## Credit / method note
This root was found by the **user driving the diagnosis** — rejecting three premature builds (a perf scare, a
held-gate that would miss the churn, a 150 ms debounce race), forcing the bytecode read that exposed the
`holding_actor`-vs-`grabbing_actor` gate, and naming `holdPlayer` as the deterministic signal. The lesson:
when a fix fails, re-derive the trigger from the bytecode before patching the wrapper —

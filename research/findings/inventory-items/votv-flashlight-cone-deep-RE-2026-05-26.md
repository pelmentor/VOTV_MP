# VOTV flashlight cone — DEEP RE findings 2026-05-26

Phase 5F follow-up: wire works (sent=4 applied=4 cross-peer), Intensity
field flips correctly via SetIntensity reflection (5.0/0.0), but no
visible flashlight cone renders on the puppet. This document
consolidates the deep-RE evidence so the next iteration is
evidence-backed rather than iterative-guess (per
`feedback-deep-re-no-iteration`).

## Tool inventory used

- IDA Pro MCP on `VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe` (uptime 4+ days; full
  hexrays + strings cache ready)
- CXX header dumps at `Game_0.9.0n/WindowsNoEditor/VotV/Binaries/Win64/CXXHeaderDump/`
  - Engine.hpp lines 13501-13700 (ULightComponent family)
  - mainPlayer.hpp (VOTV-specific player blueprint)
- 3 parallel agents (light registration RE / orphan audit /
  force-register paths) — synthesized
- Diagnostic readbacks added to `ApplyToPuppet` — ran LAN
  autonomous test, captured field values on BOTH puppet AND local
  light_R for differential analysis

## IDA-confirmed facts

### ULightComponent::SetIntensity native = `sub_142A930E0`

```c
__int64 SetIntensity(this, float NewIntensity) {
    bool isCDO = IsCDO_or_template(this);  // sub_1429EF470
    if ((isCDO || !(this+0x88 & 1) || this+0x14F) && NewIntensity != this+0x20C) {
        this+0x20C = NewIntensity;
        return PushColorAndBrightnessToProxy(this);  // sub_142A98430
    }
    return isCDO;
}
```

Guard = "AreDynamicDataChangesAllowed": `IsCDO || !bRegistered || Mobility != Static`. In our case both lights are at runtime (not CDO), `bRegistered`=1 (bit 0 of byte +0x88), Mobility=2 (Movable). So `Mobility != Static` → write proceeds.

### `PushColorAndBrightnessToProxy` = `sub_142A98430`

```c
void Push(this) {
    proxy = *(QWORD*)(this + 0x3F8);  // FLightSceneProxy*
    if (!proxy) return;  // <-- HARD NO-OP if proxy is null
    // Compute LightColor * Intensity → m128
    // Write proxy+0x120, proxy+0x28, proxy+0x2C
    // Enqueue render command via ENQUEUE_RENDER_COMMAND macro
}
```

`+0x3F8` IS the SceneProxy in this build. Confirmed via the constructor
`sub_142AF2AB0` which zero-inits 130 qwords (= 0x410 bytes); the
write at `qword[127] = 0x3F8` is the proxy slot being zeroed.

### Proxy creator = `sub_142A7B590` (the `CreateRenderState_Concurrent` virtual)

Two vtable xrefs (`0x144069488`, `0x145126588`) — virtual, not directly callable. Body:

```c
char CreateRenderState_Concurrent(this) {
    sub_1429E7950(this);  // sets byte+0x88 = (current & 0x1D) | 2 → bit 1 ("bRenderStateCreated")
    v2 = 0;
    if (this+0x229 != 1 || this+0x230 != 0 || sub_142A8EB10(this)) v2 = 1;
    if (this+0x214 & 1) {  // bAffectsWorld
        if (v2) {
            if (sub_142A6CCB0(this)) {  // ShadowQuality <= ScalabilityLimit
                if (sub_142A6CD30(this)) {  // VISIBILITY CASCADE (see below)
                    // ... permissive: if any of [this+0x288 != 0, IsServer-fast,
                    // Mobility-in-range && fast-path] → alloc + construct proxy ...
                    v6 = needsProxy ? FLightSceneProxy::Construct(Malloc(0x140), this) : 0;
                    this+0x3F8 = v6;  // <-- WRITE PROXY (possibly null)
                    if (v6) {
                        scene = this+0xA8;  // World
                        scene->Scene->AddLight(v6);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return v2;
}
```

### Visibility cascade `sub_142A6CD30`

```c
bool sub_142A6CD30(this) {
    parent = this+0xC0;  // AttachParent
    owner = this+0xA8;   // Owner cache
    if (!owner) owner = sub_1429EE5A0(this);  // GetOwner() lazy
    if (!parent || (gp = sub_1428CC620(parent)) == 0 || sub_142A6CD30(gp)) {  // recurse up attach
        v5 = owner && sub_142F8AEB0(owner);
        v6 = vtable[+0x468](this) && (!parent || (parent+0x58 & 0x20) == 0);
        return v5 && v6 && (this+0x14C & 0x20) != 0;  // <-- visByte bit 5
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Critical:** the final gate is `this+0x14C & 0x20 != 0` — visByte bit 5.

## Observed diagnostic readings (autonomous LAN test 2026-05-26)

After 4 iterations of DebugForceToggle (which bypasses BP — directly
writes `flashlight` bool + calls SetIntensity), the diagnostic dump
shows:

| field | puppet | local |
|---|---|---|
| `light` ptr | 0x000001A6C72ABD80 | 0x000001A607D32E00 |
| `SceneProxy@+0x3F8` | **NULL** | **NULL** |
| `Intensity@+0x20C` | 5.00 (latest write) | 0.00 / 5.00 (toggle in flight) |
| `bRegistered@+0x88 bit 0` | 1 | 1 |
| `bVisible@+0x14C bit 4` | 0 | 0 |
| `bHiddenInGame@+0x14D bit 2` | 0 | 0 |
| `Mobility@+0x14F` | 2 (Movable) | 2 (Movable) |
| `bAffectsWorld@+0x214 bit 0` | 1 | 1 |
| `regByte@+0x88` | 0x2B | 0x0B |
| `visByte@+0x14C` | 0x63 | 0x43 |
| `worldByte@+0x214` | 0x1F | 0x1F |
| `AttachParent@+0xC0` | 0x000001A5E1B5D800 | 0x000001A5F87DB780 |

Both regByte+visByte have **bit 1** set (= bRenderStateCreated) — so
`sub_1429E7950` ran on both → `sub_142A7B590` executed on both → ran
through the gating logic. But the proxy is NULL on both.

**Crucial diff: puppet has visByte bit 5 (0x20) SET; local has it CLEAR.** The visibility cascade gate `this+0x14C & 0x20 != 0`:
- Puppet PASSES → would proceed to proxy creation
- Local FAILS → returns 0 → proxy creation skipped

Yet puppet's proxy is still NULL → some OTHER gate inside the
proxy-creation block failed (probably the permissive `v2` from the
top OR-condition, or one of the inner net-mode / scene-allocation
checks).

## VOTV-specific: `flashlightStateChanged` delegate

mainPlayer.hpp:184-185 declares:

```cpp
FmainPlayer_CFlashlightStateChanged flashlightStateChanged;  // 0x0AC8
void flashlightStateChanged(USpotLightComponent* Light, bool Visible);  // signature
```

This is a **multicast dynamic delegate** broadcast on flashlight
toggle. Subscribers (likely cooked `prop_equipment_flashlight_C`
instances + possibly map-side props) receive `(Light, Visible)` and
do whatever their BP graph does — could include spawning a beam
actor, activating a particle, lighting a separate actor, etc.

The CXX dump shows VOTV's mainPlayer.hpp has 2 candidates for the
toggle path:
- `updateFlashlight()` (line 435)
- `Flashlight Update()` (line 488, literal space — IDA exec thunk verified earlier)

Plus the input events (lines 600-601) and an internal
`flashlightStateChanged__DelegateSignature` (line 819).

## Key uncertainty (the question for the user)

The user previously stated the local flashlight cone renders
visually during hands-on F-press. Our autonomous diagnostic shows
local.SceneProxy = NULL during DebugForceToggle (which bypasses BP).
Three explanations:

A. **The flashlight cone is rendered by a separate actor, not
   USpotLightComponent.** The BP broadcasts `flashlightStateChanged`,
   and a subscriber spawns/activates a beam. The SpotLightComponent
   contributes scene LIGHTING (illumination of nearby surfaces) but
   not the visible cone. Our puppet doesn't broadcast → no subscriber
   → no beam.

B. **The local cone DOES render via SpotLightComponent, but the
   proxy is created during the BP's first F-press path (which we
   bypass with DebugForceToggle).** A normal hands-on F-press fires
   `InpActEvt_flashlight_K2Node_InputActionEvent_13`, which the BP
   compiles to a path that involves SetVisibility +
   SetIntensity + broadcast — and one of those calls triggers
   `MarkRenderStateDirty` which schedules `RecreateRenderState_Concurrent`
   at end-of-frame, creating the proxy. Our DebugForceToggle only
   does the field write, never goes through that dirty-mark path.

C. **The `+0x3F8` offset is wrong for this build.** The IDA-decompile
   of `sub_142A98430` clearly reads `+0x3F8` as the SceneProxy, but
   maybe the actual rendered field is at a different non-reflected
   offset. (Unlikely given the constructor zeros qword[127] at the
   same offset — but worth eliminating.)

## Targeted fix candidates (NOT yet applied — awaiting verification)

If (A): broadcast `flashlightStateChanged(puppet.light_R, on)` from
ApplyToPuppet via reflection. This invokes whatever the BP-side
subscribers do. Need to find the multicast `__DelegateSignature`
UFunction.

If (B): call `Flashlight Update` UFunction on the puppet via
reflection (we have its address — `0x000001A6122D3880` from
diagnostic). The BP graph fires SetVisibility (which calls
MarkRenderStateDirty → proxy creation). Risk: BP might early-return
on puppet (no Controller, no input state). Spoof `input_flashlight`
+ `hasFlashlight` if needed.

If (C): inspect the cxx dump's USkeletalMeshActor / actor field
offsets via reflection to confirm proxy offset by reading multiple
offsets after +0x3F8 looking for non-null heap pointers.

## What we are NOT doing yet (per RULE feedback-deep-re-no-iteration)

- NOT applying any fix yet
- NOT iterating on multiple candidates
- WAITING for user verification of the key uncertainty before
  selecting (A) / (B) / (C) and making ONE targeted change

## Commits and code state at finding

- HEAD at investigation start: `0941433`
- Local edits (uncommitted): diagnostic readbacks in
  `src/votv-coop/src/coop/item_activate.cpp` + offset additions in
  `src/votv-coop/include/ue_wrap/sdk_profile.h`. NO mutating
  "fix" code present.
- Wire layer + identity Registry: unchanged, still passes LAN test.

## 2026-05-26 EVENING -- final findings after 4 deep-RE passes

After this initial document, three additional implementation passes
were attempted, all dead-ended. Final state: ApplyToPuppet reverted
to a no-op (commit `585b2a1`).

### Pass 2: ProcessEvent call trace (`GT::SetCallTrace`)

Added a global PE-name-trace gated on a thread-local flag. Set before
invoking `Flashlight Update` via reflection on the puppet. Result:
the trace captured exactly ONE PE dispatch (the outer `Flashlight Update`
call itself) + ZERO inner UFunction calls.

**Interpretation (per Agent 2 RE):** the BP function body is a
bytecode stub that calls `ExecuteUbergraph_mainPlayer(EntryPoint)`
via the BP VM's `EX_LocalFinalFunction` opcode. The VM dispatches it
through `UObject::ProcessInternal`, NOT through `UObject::ProcessEvent`.
So our hook never saw the inner calls. The ubergraph IS the actual
flashlight-toggle code -- but on a controllerless puppet it
early-returns at BP guards (`Controller != None`, `hasFlashlight`,
`inMenu`).

### Pass 3: AddComponentByClass + FinishAddComponent

Per Agent 3's recommendation, this is the only reflection-callable
path that internally runs `UActorComponent::RegisterComponent`,
which transitively calls `CreateRenderState_Concurrent` ->
`CreateSceneProxy`.

Implemented in `item_activate.cpp::ApplyToPuppet`:
- Spawn fresh `USpotLightComponent` via `AddComponentByClass(deferred=true)`
- Set properties before Finish: `IntensityUnits=0` Unitless,
  `bAffectsWorld=1`, `OuterConeAngle=40`, `AttenuationRadius=2000`,
  `bVisible=1` (direct bit write)
- `FinishAddComponent(component, manualAttachment=false, identity-+85cm-Z)`
- Belt-and-braces: also reflection-call `SetVisibility(true, false)`

Diagnostic after FinishAddComponent confirmed: `bRegistered=1`,
`bVisible=1`, `bAffectsWorld=1`, `Mobility=2 Movable`, `Intensity=100`.
All flag bits look perfect for proxy creation. BUT the autonomous
screenshots STILL showed no visible illumination on the puppet
(daylight ambient + likely +0x3F8 ISN'T the SceneProxy for this
build's actual layout).

### Pass 4: "Invalid prop" error mesh (USER ROOT-CAUSE FEEDBACK)

User hands-on testing revealed that the orange/red "error mesh"
visible at the host puppet's position on the client's screen was
NOT a 3D placeholder mesh -- it was VOTV's in-game error UI
overlay reading:

```
Invalid prop: "prop_equipment_flashlight_C"
World context: "mainPlayer_C 2147480015"
```

The puppet's index `2147480015` is near `INT32_MAX` -- typical of
an orphan/unregistered actor. VOTV's BP listener (on flashlight
state changes OR on prop-lookup queries from anim BP) tries to
locate the `prop_equipment_flashlight_C` instance in the puppet's
inventory, finds the puppet has no inventory at all (we strip it
at spawn), and raises this error.

EVERY puppet-side mutation we attempted (AddComponentByClass
spawn, `puppet.flashlight=true` bool write, `SetIntensity` on
`puppet.light_R`) was triggering this error overlay.

### Final state -- commit 585b2a1

`ApplyToPuppet` is now a no-op:

```cpp
void ApplyToPuppet(...) {
    // validate puppet + classHash...
    g_echoSuppress.store(true);
    // -- NO bool write
    // -- NO SetIntensity
    // -- NO AddComponentByClass
    g_echoSuppress.store(false);
    UE_LOGI("flashlight: applied to puppet=%p state=%d (no-op...)", ...);
    // diagnostic readback on original light_R (read-only, observation)
}
```

The wire layer + identity registry + per-tick state are all proven
correct (sent=N applied=N every LAN test). The puppet's flashlight
state is logically replicated, but the visual rendering on the
puppet body is OPEN. No reflection mechanism is going to fix this
without triggering the "Invalid prop" error.

## Remaining options (out of Phase 5F Inc1-4 scope)

1. **Native AOB-resolved `RegisterComponentWithWorld` direct call** --
   spawn a SpotLight (via NewObject, not AddComponentByClass) and
   manually invoke RegisterComponent via a function-pointer cast
   resolved by AOB signature. Bypasses BP listeners that fire on
   AddComponent. Risk: AOB-fragile.

2. **Suppress the "Invalid prop" BP listener** -- find the BP UFunction
   raising the error, install a PRE-observer that returns true (skips
   original dispatch) for puppet world contexts. Pure reflection.
   The "Invalid prop" text in the screenshot is the hint for the
   BP function name to search for.

3. **Spawn the `prop_equipment_flashlight_C` actor on the puppet and
   add it to puppet's inventory** -- mirror what `EnsureFlashlightReady`
   does for the local player, but on the puppet. Then BP listeners
   find the prop, no error. Adds inventory-syncing complexity.

4. **Hands-on user verification then ship as wire-only** -- accept
   the visual limitation, document, move on.

Choice goes to future-session direction.

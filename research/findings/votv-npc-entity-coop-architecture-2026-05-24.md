## TL;DR

VOTV is a single-player UE4.27 game with **zero replication on its blueprints**. ~17 NPC classes (kerfur-omega, npc_zombie, the ariral family, krampus, funguy, etc.), ~1200 prop subclasses, doors/triggers/keypads, two vehicle-ish classes (ATV, drone), and a parade of timeline-driven UFO/event actors. The universal cross-peer ID is **`Key` (FName)** — already used by props, present on triggers, doors, switches, save-system actors.

The MTA model — **single-syncer per entity, server-relayed, AOI-streamed, sync-time-context-stamped** — ports cleanly. The substrate shift: MTA's "server" maps to our **host**; MTA's "syncer" maps to **whichever peer is closest** (initially: host always, until we add proximity arbitration).

**Recommended staging:** 5 phases over the next few weeks. **Phase 5N1** (host-authoritative NPC pose stream) gives the visible coop NPC sync the user is asking about; everything past 5N3 (interactables) is incremental polish until 5N5 (event/transient effects).

## Architectural model

### Authority (1-host-1-client)

| Entity class | Authority owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Player pawn | self (each peer owns its pose) | Stage 3 wire already does this |
| Physics prop (held) | the grabber | Stage 4 wire already does this; release returns to physics-everywhere |
| **NPCs (kerfur, zombie, ariral, etc.)** | **HOST always (P1)** | NPC AI runs in BP TickEvent on the host's instance; client mirrors it. Simpler than MTA's syncer model — at 2 peers there's no contention. |
| Doors, switches, triggers | **HOST always (P1)** | One-shot state, lowest-latency wins; host arbitrates concurrent presses |
| Spawnable entities (insomniac, fossilhound, etc.) | **HOST always (P1)** | Spawn is host-driven; client receives spawn event with Key + class + transform |
| Vehicles (ATV, drone) | DRIVER if occupied, else HOST | MTA's "syncer = driver" rule |
| Transient events (explosion, projectile) | INITIATOR | Reliable one-shot broadcast |
| Sounds / particles (one-shot) | INITIATOR | Unreliable, AOI-culled |

Authority is per-entity per-tick. Future: switch to MTA's proximity-based syncer when 3+ peers added (out of scope for now).

### Identity (cross-peer ID)

VOTV's `Key` FName (already used by props) is the canonical cross-peer entity ID. Two flavours:

1. **World-loaded entities** (level-spawned NPCs, doors, save-system actors): `Key` is baked into the cooked content / save UUID. **Cross-peer stable when both peers load the same save** (proven for props in Stage 4).
2. **Runtime-spawned entities** (insomniac, ariral via `launchEvent`, projectiles, explosions): `Key` is assigned by the spawning machine. **NOT cross-peer stable** — host must route the spawn through the wire, telling the client both the Key AND the spawn parameters; client spawns its own copy locally with the SAME Key.

For runtime-spawned entities, **host = the spawning machine**. Client never spawns; it receives spawn packets from host.

### Wire taxonomy (protocol v5)

Building on v4 (PoseSnapshot + PropPose + PropRelease), v5 adds:

| MsgType | Reliability | Direction | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NpcSpawn` | reliable | host → client | spawn an NPC (Key + class FName + spawn pose) |
| `NpcDespawn` | reliable | host → client | despawn an NPC (Key) |
| `NpcPose` | unreliable | host → client | per-tick pose stream (Key + transform + anim state) |
| `NpcState` | reliable | host → client | discrete state change (Key + field bitmask + values: health/mode/target) |
| `EntityEvent` | reliable | host → client | door opened, button pressed, trigger fired, etc. (Key + event-id + params) |
| `EffectFire` | unreliable | initiator → peer | one-shot explosion / projectile / sound / particle (class + transform + params) |
| `VehicleEnter`/`Exit` | reliable | initiator → host | authority handoff for vehicle |
| `VehiclePose` | unreliable | driver → others | per-tick vehicle drive |

Reliable for: state changes whose loss would desync world (spawn, despawn, door state, vehicle authority).
Unreliable for: per-tick pose / per-tick state (latest-wins via RFC1982 seq, same as PoseSnapshot).
AOI-culled (don't even SEND if peer >100m from event): EffectFire.

### Staging — 5 phases

**Phase 5N1 — NPC pose stream (kerfur, zombie, ariral subset)**
Goal: a kerfur on host visibly walks around; client sees its puppet kerfur walking the same path.

Scope:
- HOST: walk GUObjectArray once per tick, find NPCs in `m_nearbyNpcs` set (filtered by class derives from ACharacter AND class FName in {kerfurOmega_C, npc_zombie_C, npc_ariral_*}), emit NpcPose per tick.
- CLIENT: on first NpcPose for a Key, walk GUObjectArray for matching Aprop-style lookup (need a `FindNpcByKey` helper). If found locally (world-loaded), drive it kinematically. If not (runtime-spawned), receive an NpcSpawn packet first.
- Anim sync: pass yaw + speed + headLook the way mainPlayer's PoseSnapshot already does.

This is the user-visible win. Architecture mirrors player pose sync.

**Phase 5N2 — NPC spawn / despawn (host-authoritative)**
Goal: when an NPC spawns on host (e.g. host's tick spawns insomniac), client also spawns it; when killed, both despawn.

Scope:
- HOST: hook UWorld::SpawnActor for NPC classes via reflection observer (or, simpler: observe BP `Spawn Bad Sun`-style functions on mainGamemode_C). On spawn, generate a Key (or read the spawned actor's Key field), broadcast NpcSpawn.
- CLIENT: receive NpcSpawn → spawn local copy via reflection (same as we do for our player puppet). Stamp the local actor's Key field to match.
- Despawn: observe AActor::Destroy / engine-side death, broadcast NpcDespawn.

Hook surface needs RE — Stage 5N2 is research-heavy.

**Phase 5N3 — Interactables (doors, switches, triggers, keypads)**
Goal: opening a door on host opens it on client; pressing a button on host registers on client; client can also initiate (sent to host who arbitrates).

Scope:
- Bidirectional: client press → request to host → host applies + broadcasts state.
- Use the EntityEvent reliable channel.
- Hook the `fireTrigger` / `runTrigger` BP UFunctions (per VOTV survey) — they ARE BP-dispatched (impure, exec-pin).
- Multi-peer keypad UX problem: `ApasswordLock_C.isFocused` should be replicated so two players don't type into the same keypad simultaneously.

**Phase 5N4 — Vehicles (ATV, drone)**
Goal: host driving the ATV; client sees the ATV move + the host puppet on it.

Scope:
- AATV_C has Pawn-style controller-input → physics drive. Driver-authoritative.
- The kerfur passenger field (`kerfur_passenger`) needs replication.
- Drone is timeline-driven (no controller); simpler — just stream pose.

**Phase 5N5 — Transient events (explosions, projectiles, sound/particle)**
Goal: when host shoots an alien dart, client sees the dart fly; when an explosion fires, both peers hear/see it.

Scope:
- AOI-cull: only broadcast events within `MAX_EXPLOSION_SYNC_DISTANCE` of the recipient.
- Reliable for discrete events (explosion = state change in the world).
- Unreliable for cosmetic (footstep sound).
- Reuse the Aprop_C.thrown(player) dispatch pattern shipped for grab.

### Implementation patterns to copy from MTA (per the research note)

1. **`sync time context` byte** — every entity has a 1-byte counter bumped on every server-authoritative state change. In-flight unreliable packets stamped with the old context are silently dropped. We already have RFC1982 seq for pose; for entities we should add a per-entity context byte stamped on spawn/teleport/state-change.

2. **Flag-byte delta encoding** — `CPedSync` sends 1 byte indicating which of 8 fields are present, then only those fields' bytes. NpcState would do the same: 1 byte for which of {health, mode, target, anim, etc.} is present + only those values. Saves ~80% wire bandwidth on entities whose state barely changes.

3. **Near/far rate split** — `CPedSyncPacket` sends per-packet for nearby peers, 2-second batched for far peers. For our 1-host-1-client topology this collapses to a single tier, but the AOI cull is still relevant (don't stream the basement insomniac when the client is on the satellite).

4. **AOI streaming** — fixed-grid sector AOI with hysteresis. For VOTV's map size (a few km) and entity count (likely <100 active at once), even a flat O(N) check per peer is fine; sector grid is premature optimisation.

5. **Reliable+sequenced spawn / despawn** — same as our current PropRelease channel. No re-engineering.

6. **Server validates `pEntity->GetSyncer() == sender`** — for VOTV, in 5N1-5N2 only host emits (validation = "is this packet from the host?"). For 5N3 client-initiated events, host validates the requesting peer has legitimate proximity to the entity.

### Hook surface (what RULES require RE'ing FIRST)

Per `feedback_re_related_functions`, before any of Phase 5N1-5N5 is implemented, RE each of these:

| Function | Class | Phase | RE needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aiTick`, `BehaviourTreeUpdate` | npc_zombie_C, kerfurOmega_C | 5N1 | What ticks the AI? When does it run? Can we observe its outputs (target / mode changes) without intercepting it? |
| `TakeDamage`, `Die`, `OnDeath` | all NPC classes | 5N2 | Death event dispatch — for despawn replication |
| `fireTrigger`, `runTrigger`, `setActiveTrigger` | AtriggerBase_C | 5N3 | Are these ProcessEvent-dispatched (impure) or BP-pure? |
| `doorOpened`, `Open`, `Close` | Adoor_C | 5N3 | Same |
| `Aexplosion_C.BeginPlay`, `postExplosion` | Aexplosion_C | 5N5 | Engine SpawnActor hook — observe spawn at this class |
| `mainGamemode_C.spawnPropThroughGamemode` | mainGamemode_C | 5N2 | Hook for host-routed spawn |
| `AnailProjectile_C / AgrimeProjectile_C` | projectile classes | 5N5 | Lifecycle: spawn → tick → hit/destroy |
| `AATV_C.input` / occupancy | AATV_C | 5N4 | Driver detection, input replication |

### Risks / open questions

1. **AI in two places**: if HOST runs AI for NPCs and CLIENT's local copy also runs AI (because the same blueprint loads on both), the client's NPC will diverge from host's. **Solution:** suppress AI tick on the client's NPC copy via reflection (set `SetActorTickEnabled(false)` on the controller, or null out the AIController), only drive it from the wire. This is the analog of how we disable physics on client-side props during grab.

2. **Save persistence**: when host's NPC dies, the death is persisted in the save. Does the client's save reflect this? Currently the client loads its own save independently — the death wouldn't persist unless we propagate save events. **Likely out of scope** for the initial phase; coop runs are ephemeral.

3. **Mass scale**: VOTV has 1200+ prop subclasses, ~17 NPC classes. Streaming everything is wasteful. **Solution:** AOI radius per entity type — props 50m, NPCs 200m, large vehicles 500m, explosions 300m.

4. **Cross-class instantiation parity**: client receiving an NpcSpawn for `Anpc_zombie_C` must have that class registered. Cooked content has them all baked; runtime spawn via FindClass should work, but the BP graph's `BeginPlay` may have side effects we don't want (e.g. NPC plays a spawn sound, decides on a target). **Solution:** spawn the class but suppress its tick + AI until it's been "synced into existence".

5. **Sync-time-context vs key**: an entity could (rare) be despawned + respawned with the same Key. The sync-time-context byte handles this — bumped on spawn → stale packets dropped.

### Decisions needed from user before code starts

1. **Phase ordering**: 5N1 first (NPC pose stream) seems right. Confirm?
2. **Authority model**: host-always for 5N1-5N3 is the simplest. Driver-authoritative for vehicles in 5N4 OK?
3. **AOI defaults**: 200m NPC radius reasonable, or wider/narrower?
4. **Suppression strategy**: kill client-side AI tick (preferred) vs run AI on both + correct via host stream (more bandwidth but smoother on packet loss)?
5. **Save persistence**: in/out of scope for 5N?

# ROADMAP — VOTV coop mod

**Living document.** Re-arrange as priorities shift. Phases follow
`docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md`, adapted for UE4.27 + UE4SS. Each phase has a
hard gate — don't proceed until met.

## Phase 0 — Feasibility + bootstrap
**Goal**: prove viability; lay down repo shape.
**Gate**: `docs/FEASIBILITY.md` answers 0.2–0.8; skeleton committed.

- ☑ Read methodology; confirm UE4.27 + approach (UE4SS + reflection).
- ☑ `docs/FEASIBILITY.md` written (no blockers found).
- ◐ Directory layout + skeleton docs + `.gitignore` + `CLAUDE.md`.
- ☐ Vendor references: `reference/RE-UE4SS/`, `reference/mtasa-blue/`.
- ☐ First commit (skeleton + submodule pins).

## Phase 1 — Engine archaeology (mostly reflection, not RE)
**Goal**: a research finding for each engine entry point we'll hook.
**Gate**: all of the below documented in `research/findings/`.

- ☐ 1.1 Entity factory — confirm `UWorld::SpawnActor` path for VOTV pawn.
- ☐ 1.2 Player class layout — VOTV pawn + controller class names, key
       properties (position via `AActor`, health, inventory, mode).
- ☐ 1.3 Input dispatch path — `APlayerController` / `UPlayerInput` /
       `UCharacterMovementComponent` input consumption.
- ☐ 1.4 Sim tick — UE `UWorld::Tick` / actor tick groups VOTV relies on.
- ☐ 1.5 Render tick — confirm decoupling (UE renders on its own thread).
- ☐ 1.6 Level-load entry + completion — `UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel` /
       `LoadStreamLevel` + post-load callback used by VOTV.
- ☐ 1.7 Save / load entry — VOTV's `USaveGame` load `UFunction`; file
       location, layout, encryption.
- ☐ 1.8 Screen / UI system — VOTV's UMG/HUD stack; how menus push/pop.
- ☐ 1.9 Script VM — Blueprint VM; map key gameplay `UFunction`s (AI,
       interaction, day cycle, signals). Blueprint-vs-C++ split.

## Phase 2 — Foundation infrastructure
**Gate**: spawn a 2nd `APawn` + `APlayerController` (the "orphan") and
have it tick without crashing for ≥60 s (target several minutes).

- ☐ 2.1 Spawn the orphan via `SpawnActor` (the cheapest derisk).
- ☐ 2.2 Crash-by-crash root-cause fixes (per-site, no broad filters).
- ☐ 2.3 Registry / state mirror for any per-player subsystem VOTV/UE
       expects (subsystems registered per `APlayerController`).
- ☐ 2.4 Sustained-soak validation (orphan idle, real player plays).

## Phase 3 — Networking transport
**Gate**: both players see each other's pawn moving in real time on LAN
(position only; T-pose slide OK).

- ☐ 3.1 UDP, host-authoritative, LAN-first.
- ☐ 3.2 Sessions, not connections.
- ☐ 3.3 Pure I/O at bottom; 3-layer split.
- ☐ 3.4 Position-only pose sync (~13–30 Hz) + interpolation.
- ☐ 3.5 Auto-spawn the remote on first packet.

## Phase 4 — Replication layers (the bulk)
- ☐ 4.1 Input replication (MTA keysync pattern → engine drives the pawn).
- ☐ 4.2 Equipment / held-item / tool state.
- ☐ 4.3 Entity manifest + per-entity state (NPCs, interactables, signals).
- ☐ 4.4 Cutscenes / scripted events (Blueprint event RPC + skip semantics).
- ☐ 4.5 Save / world-state sync (host-authoritative).
- ☐ 4.6 Inventory / progression (shared, host-side; client UI overlays).

## Phase 5 — Validation
- ☐ 5.1 Autonomous test harness (boot, drive via synthetic input, JSON).
- ☐ 5.2 LAN soak (dual-process).
- ☐ 5.3 Live testing (side-by-side windows; observation log).
- ☐ 5.4 Multi-agent audit (WP2; MTA-fidelity audit mandatory for network
       / replication / class-design work).

## Timeline note

Per the methodology's final note: coop is a 6-month-to-2-year effort.
UE4SS + reflection should compress Phase 1 (no blind RE) and de-risk
Phase 2 (engine natively supports multiple pawns) versus the GTA:SA
baseline — but Phase 4 (replication) remains the bulk regardless of engine.

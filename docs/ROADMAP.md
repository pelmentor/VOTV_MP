# ROADMAP — VOTV coop mod

**Living document.** Re-arrange as priorities shift. Phases follow
`docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md`, adapted for UE4.27 + UE4SS. Each phase has a
hard gate — don't proceed until met.

Legend: ☐ not started · ◐ in progress · ☑ done.

## Phase 0 — Feasibility + bootstrap
**Goal**: prove viability; lay down repo shape.
**Gate**: `docs/FEASIBILITY.md` answers 0.2–0.8; skeleton committed.

- ☑ Read methodology; confirm UE4.27 + approach (UE4SS + reflection).
- ☑ `docs/FEASIBILITY.md` written (no blockers found).
- ☑ Directory layout + skeleton docs + `.gitignore` + `CLAUDE.md`.
- ☑ Vendor references: `reference/RE-UE4SS/` (7f7cc36),
       `reference/mtasa-blue/` (c07ccb0).
- ☑ First commit (skeleton + submodule pins) — `43a6a11`.

**Phase 0 gate: MET.** Proceed to Phase 1 (engine archaeology via
reflection). First concrete derisk: Phase 2.1 spawn-orphan experiment can
be pulled forward once UE4SS is installed against the game.

- ☑ UE4SS v3.0.1 installed into the game (`tools/install-ue4ss.ps1`;
       additive, principle 1 intact). IDA MCP holds the shipping binary as
       the RE fallback. See `research/findings/coop-phase-0-ue4ss-bootstrap-2026-05-21.md`.
- ☐ **(needs user)** One interactive launch to verify UE4SS injects (4.27
       detected) and capture reflection dumps: `CTRL+H` (C++ headers) +
       `CTRL+J` (object dump) at main menu, then again in-world.

## Phase 1 — Engine archaeology (mostly reflection, not RE)
**Goal**: a research finding for each engine entry point we'll hook.
**Gate**: all of the below documented in `research/findings/`.

- ☑ 1.1 Entity factory — `UWorld::SpawnActor`; 2nd player via
       `UGameplayStatics::CreatePlayer` (engine-native). See finding
       `coop-phase-1-player-class-and-spawn-2026-05-21.md`.
- ☑ 1.2 Player class layout — pawn `AmainPlayer_C : ACharacter` (camera,
       grab/hold, stats, inventory mapped); controller = stock
       `APlayerController`; GameMode `AmainGamemode_C` (world/save hub).
- ☑ 1.3 Input dispatch path — stock `APlayerController`; VOTV input = pawn
       `InpActEvt_*` BP events. Full vocabulary mapped (movement, jump,
       crouch, run, fire, drop, inventory, hotbar 1-10, flashlight,
       equipment, ...) → 4.1 keysync. See finding
       `coop-phase-1-input-map-and-spawn-probe-2026-05-21.md`.
- ☐ 1.4 Sim tick — UE `UWorld::Tick` / actor tick groups VOTV relies on.
- ☐ 1.5 Render tick — confirm decoupling (UE renders on its own thread).
- ☐ 1.6 Level-load entry + completion — `UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel` /
       `LoadStreamLevel` + post-load callback used by VOTV.
- ◐ 1.7 Save / load entry — `UsaveSlot_C::save(...)` / `savePlayerOnly()`,
       `Usave_main_C::save()`; world-apply on GameMode (`Load Primitives`,
       `loadObjects`, `loadTriggers`). Load *entry* call-graph pending
       (Live View / IDA, Phase 4.5).
- ☐ 1.8 Screen / UI system — VOTV's UMG/HUD stack; how menus push/pop.
- ☐ 1.9 Script VM — Blueprint VM; map key gameplay `UFunction`s (AI,
       interaction, day cycle, signals). Blueprint-vs-C++ split.

## Phase 2 — Foundation infrastructure
**Gate**: spawn a 2nd `APawn` + `APlayerController` (the "orphan") and
have it tick without crashing for ≥60 s (target several minutes).

- ◐ 2.1 Spawn the orphan — via `SpawnActor<AmainPlayer_C>` on our own path
       (NOT `CreatePlayer`/split-screen — that's local-player baggage).
       SplitScreenMod only proves a 2nd pawn can exist; not the impl.
       Needs an interactive run to confirm our orphan ticks.
- ☐ 2.2 Crash-by-crash root-cause fixes (per-site, no broad filters).
- ☐ 2.3 Registry / state mirror for any per-player subsystem VOTV/UE
       expects (subsystems registered per `APlayerController`).
- ☐ 2.4 Sustained-soak validation (orphan idle, real player plays).

## Phase 3 — Networking transport
**Gate**: both players see each other's pawn moving in real time on LAN
(position only; T-pose slide OK).

- ☐ 3.1 UDP, host-authoritative, LAN-first.
- ☐ 3.2 Sessions, not connections.
- ☐ 3.3 Pure I/O at bottom; 3-layer split.
- ☐ 3.4 Position-only pose sync (~13–30 Hz) + interpolation.
- ☐ 3.5 Auto-spawn the remote on first packet.

## Phase 4 — Replication layers (the bulk)
- ☐ 4.1 Input replication (MTA keysync pattern → engine drives the pawn).
- ☐ 4.2 Equipment / held-item / tool state.
- ☐ 4.3 Entity manifest + per-entity state (NPCs, interactables, signals).
- ☐ 4.4 Cutscenes / scripted events (Blueprint event RPC + skip semantics).
- ☐ 4.5 Save / world-state sync (host-authoritative).
- ☐ 4.6 Inventory / progression (shared, host-side; client UI overlays).

## Phase 5 — Validation
- ☐ 5.1 Autonomous test harness (boot, drive via synthetic input, JSON).
- ☐ 5.2 LAN soak (dual-process).
- ☐ 5.3 Live testing (side-by-side windows; observation log).
- ☐ 5.4 Multi-agent audit (WP2; MTA-fidelity audit mandatory for network
       / replication / class-design work).

## Timeline note

Per the methodology's final note: coop is a 6-month-to-2-year effort.
UE4SS + reflection should compress Phase 1 (no blind RE) and de-risk
Phase 2 (engine natively supports multiple pawns) versus the GTA:SA
baseline — but Phase 4 (replication) remains the bulk regardless of engine.

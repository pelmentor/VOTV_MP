## TL;DR — read this first

- **A pile is `actorChipPile_C`.** It is KEYLESS and has **NO cross-peer identity** of any
  kind. Bytecode-verified on the cooked pak (see `re-artifacts/`): no Key field, `setKey()`
  is a no-op the BP discards, `gatherDataFromKey` hardcodes `gather=false`, and a pile
  persists as a `primitivesData` record (class+transform+chipType) that loads by
  **destroy-all-int_primitive + fresh POSITIONAL respawn**. The only handle a pile can have
  across peers is a HOST-MINTED eid the coop layer assigns and streams.
- **The recurring bug is a JOIN DUPE** (the client ends with 2 of each pile) **+ an
  interaction dupe** (the client spamming E accumulates local-only clumps).
- **A working scheme existed (~June 12-13, committed in the June-10 batch `77225106`):
  "stale save → reconcile".** The client loaded the host's stale `.sav` (so it had its own
  copy of every pile), the host streamed a keyless eid per pile, and a **reconcile**
  (adopt-by-position at the snapshot bracket + a divergence sweep for residue) bound the
  client's OWN pile actor onto the host eid — one actor, no dupe. See [01-HISTORY.md](01-HISTORY.md).
- **What broke it:** a long chain of "improvements" (live-save switch → position-bind seed →
  death-watch → reaper → thin-client doom → save-strip) progressively replaced the
  adopt-by-position reconcile with fresh-spawn-mirror + destroy-the-original mechanisms that
  never converge. The latest (save-strip) was REVERTED 2026-06-20.
- **The plan:** restore the adopt-by-position reconcile (it is intact at committed HEAD
  `1272b0a3`'s `EnsurePileBindIndex`) and fix the interaction dupe at its real root (the
  freed-mirror re-stream trigger). See [03-RESTORATION-PLAN.md](03-RESTORATION-PLAN.md).

## What is a pile, exactly (the engine facts)

| Fact | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Class | `AactorChipPile_C` (+ subclasses `_erie`/`_wetConcrete`/`_leaves`) | `re-artifacts/chipPile.json`, CXXHeaderDump |
| Interfaces | `int_objects_C` + `int_save_C` + `int_primitive_C` | re-artifacts |
| Identity | **NONE.** No Key field; `setKey()` writes a transient frame nothing reads | `re-artifacts/chipPile.json` (getData/getKey hardcode "None") |
| Save (objectsData) | `getData` writes a key="None" struct_save record @ objectsData | `re-artifacts/saveObjects_dump.txt` |
| Save (primitivesData) | `getPrimitiveData` writes class+transform+chipType-json @ primitivesData (the LOAD-authoritative array) | `re-artifacts/mainGamemode.json` (Save Primitives) |
| Load | `loadObjects` spawns from objectsData, then "Load Primitives" DESTROYS all int_primitive and RESPAWNS positionally from primitivesData | `re-artifacts/loadObjects_dump.txt` |
| Grab/morph | grabbing a pile runs the BP `toClump()` → spawns a `prop_garbageClump_C` (the carried "ball") | `findings/votv-chippile-clump-morph-RE-2026-05-27.md` |
| Why no save-strip | the save-loaded pile IS what the coop layer adopts as the mirror; stripping it leaves the client with NO piles | session 32 hands-on (this folder) |

## The two bugs, precisely

1. **JOIN DUPE** — on join the client loads the host save (its own ~870 piles) AND the host
   streams a mirror eid per pile. If the mirror **adopts onto** the client's pile → 1 actor,
   correct. If it **fresh-spawns a separate mirror** (or the doom that should delete the
   original never fires) → 2 actors = the dupe. The recent stack fresh-spawns + relies on a
   doom that wedges (`liveMirrors < expected`, never converges). Full RCA:
   [02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md](02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md) §1.
2. **INTERACTION DUPE (E-spam)** — the join's same-world "shadow-drain" (a mass actor purge)
   FREES the host pile-mirror actors; the catalog isn't decremented and the re-stream that
   should re-materialize them is gated behind a purge-episode-EXIT edge that never fires under
   churn → the piles the player walks up to are mirror-UNBOUND → grabbing one mints a
   permanent local-only `prop_garbageClump_C` (eid=0) that no relay suppresses and no doom
   reaps. Full RCA: [02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md](02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md) §2.

## Cross-cutting truth FIRST (read these before the pile-specific docs)

The pile dupe was, at root, a **"which seam expresses this entity?" / "will my hook fire?"** problem.
Those questions are now answered canonically (code-verified, confidence-tagged) in:
- **[../COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md](../COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md)** — every entity's spawn→catch→
  identity→destroy, incl. the chipPile/clump dupe matrix.
- **[../COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md](../COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md)** — VISIBLE vs INVISIBLE dispatch +
  which of our seams can/can't see what (the `init()`-is-`EX_LocalVirtualFunction` fact that killed the
  take-18 Init-POST bet).

These supersede the cross-cutting parts of the pile docs below; 01-04 remain the pile-specific
history/diagnosis/design, and **08 is the CURRENT design** (the host-authoritative trash channel);
**07 is SUPERSEDED + RETIRED** (the morph -- a real hands-on refuted its smoke "VERIFIED" 2026-06-21).

  arc is DONE + verified; the CLIENT-grab direction (Increment 2) is the FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness].**
  Host-authoritative
  trash-entity identity (eid = logical entity), MTA single-syncer + sync-time-context byte. **GRAB
  (pile→clump) = VERIFIED hands-on** via the `InpActEvt_use` PRE seam + the held-edge adopt. **RE-PILE

  spawned pile the same tick — zero proximity, no reaper race (the ~5s vanish-return is gone by construction).
  The thunk DETECTION is VERIFIED (read-only pass agreed ptr-for-ptr with the old death-watch); the CONVERT +
  the triple-grab-cue fix (`fea04c26`) are deployed-pending-hands-on. The proximity death-watch is RETIRED
  (RULE 2). **The s35 "BeginDeferred-POST is observable" link was DISPROVEN** (EX_CallMath → invisible; 0

  gone [V], level-placed native-coexistence root confirmed, fix pending)**
  (deployed `c2a5f49cc98add31`, `coop/trash_proxy`): an `AStaticMeshActor` WE own (NO blueprint, `AddToRoot`, our
  eid→actor registry, re-skin in place on convert) replaces the real self-morphing BP mirror → the client
  mirror-staleness dup is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION (the 3-verdict discriminator / health-poll / serial-check
  plan is DROPPED as moot). The dup-gone + the resting/landed-pile mirror are hands-on confirmed (incl. the
  `SetComponentMobility(Movable)` visibility fix, `245148c6` — a runtime `AStaticMeshActor` is STATIC by
  default → `SetStaticMesh` no-ops). **The host grabbing + carrying a pile — the CARRY-FREEZE is now FIXED,
  hands-on VERIFIED** via the **`!carrying` release-edge gate** in `local_streams.cpp` (the client clump
  UPDATES through the carry now, no freeze between E-events). The earlier "carry MIRRORS on a settled join /
  the failure was the JOIN RACE" claim was **WITHDRAWN as FALSE**; the actual release-edge cause was
  `updateHold` PUPPET RECREATION (the `heldActor` ptr changes with `pendingSettle=0`), NOT a contact-re-pile
  churn. **Host carries FINE; OTHER props mirror fine.** **NOW FIXED/BUILT this session:** carry JANK — FIXED
  [V] (shipped `df158728`; the `key.len=4`→keyless theory DISPROVEN — `GetKey`=`"None"` both forms, receiver
  already guards `keyW != "None"`→eid; REAL root = interp PHASE-STALL `BeginLerpToPose`/`AdvanceLerp` sample
  the same `nowMs` → alpha=0; FIX = fixed-delay snapshot interp, MTA `CClientVehicle` shape → carry now
  SMOOTH); proxy SCALE — BUILT v83, hands-on PENDING (shipped `df158728`, v82→v83; added `scaleX/Y/Z` to
  `PropConvertPayload` + `GetActorScale3D`/`SetActorScale3D` + `ApplyProxyScale` — the prior "@protocol.h had
  scale" was `PropSpawnPayload`, not `PropConvertPayload`); ORPHAN dup — SPLIT (DERIVED gone [V]; ORIGINAL
  level-placed STILL dup — the client's NATIVE level-loaded chipPile is never reconciled away → it coexists
  with the host's proxy; the sweep is blind to natives; FIX NOT built = destroy the native at proxy-spawn,
  exact ~1cm match; a read-only PILE-PROBE shipped `29069f05`); the `simulateDrop` throw-velocity FLIP is DEAD
  — REPLACED by carry/flight stream-continuity (shipped `136ed779`: BOTH `simulateDrop`+`dropGrabObject`
  thunks fire ZERO for the clump release; the release-edge `!carrying`-SKIP branch now streams the LIVE clump's
  flight pose under E until it re-piles, `IsLive`-gated; hands-on PENDING; the dead `dropGrabObject` thunk to
  be retired RULE 2 next). **Dead ends:** option 1 (`8bc797ef`,
  `SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false)` on the held clump) BUILT + FAILED — the live host BP re-arms hit-notify;
  option 2 (the `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate) is **DISPROVEN by bytecode** — `holdPlayer` is set ONCE on grab
  and NEVER cleared in any BP, so it cannot mark "released" (DEAD, NOT pending). Phase 1 = visual + position +
  re-skin, NoCollision. The client-grab direction (Increment 2) is the **FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness]**
  (proto **v85**, HEAD `29353191`, deployed `BB94A120A969A51E`): a client AIMS at a mirrored pile (a
  camera-ray cone — the trace/`lookatActorCurrent`/collision approach RETIRED, RULE 2: a bare proxy can't be
  `lookAtActor` + the pile mesh has no collision body), GRABS, CARRIES (the new host-auth per-eid
  `TrashCarryPose` stream), THROWS (self-re-piles), all via the REAL E-press path. What's STILL OPEN

## Status (2026-06-23; HEAD `29353191`, deployed `BB94A120A969A51E`, proto v85, push held) — DESIGN → AS-BUILT → VERIFIED

The whole saga below (01–04 + the s21–s33 session-log) converged on **08 — the host-authoritative trash
channel**, which is the CURRENT design + as-built. The day-to-day live state is in the auto-memory
(`MEMORY.md` index + the top `project_session*` entry); this is the durable summary:

1. **GRAB (pile→clump) — VERIFIED hands-on** (`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`) via the `InpActEvt_use` PRE seam + the
   held-edge adopt. Identity is the host-minted eid end-to-end, NO proximity.
2. **RE-PILE (clump→pile) — the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter** (commit `d19ae4d4`,
   `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`): the thunk catches the clump's `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred` and converts E onto
   the EXACT spawned pile the same tick — zero proximity, no reaper race. The thunk DETECTION is **VERIFIED**
   (a read-only pass agreed ptr-for-ptr with the prior proximity death-watch, which is now RETIRED, RULE 2);
   the CONVERT flip + the triple-grab-cue fix (`fea04c26`, the ctx-gate requireCurrentGen split) are
   **AS-BUILT** (logged GREEN on `BA79E705` in the A+B run; now folded into the deployed proxy build
   `69405445`). The single grab cue + no vanish-return remain hands-on-PENDING. Runbook:
   `research/handson_runbook_2026-06-21_repile_thunk.md` (take-22).
3. **CLIENT mirror-staleness dup — phase-1 proxy: DUP-FIX (derived) + VISIBILITY + CARRY-FREEZE + carry-JANK
   hands-on VERIFIED; proxy SCALE BUILT v83 hands-on-pending; the throw arc is now a flight-stream (hands-on
   pending); the ORPHAN dup is SPLIT (derived gone [V], level-placed native-coexistence root confirmed, fix
   pending). HEAD `29069f05`,
   deployed `c2a5f49cc98add31`** (the derived dup was OPEN, now fixed by construction). The client's mirror of trash is now a host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` we
   own (NO blueprint, `AddToRoot`, our eid→actor registry; re-skin in place on convert) instead of the real
   self-morphing BP — so the staleness dup (a join-mirror going NOT-LIVE within ~10s → fresh-clump spawn +
   original lingering) is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION. **The dup is GONE and the resting + landed piles mirror
   VISIBLY (hands-on confirmed):** `0` `mirror NOT-FOUND` in the smoke + the user confirmed it works; a runtime
   `AStaticMeshActor` is STATIC mobility by default (on which `SetStaticMesh` no-ops → the proxies were
   INVISIBLE in the render-blind smoke), fixed with `SetComponentMobility(Movable)` (`245148c6`). Commits
   `06685a9c` + `1011e512` (CRITICAL per-slot-disconnect leak) + `3d371349` (HIGH-1/2 + MEDIUM-1) +
   `095dbf44`/`8a17faeb` (lerp/freeze). Phase 1 = visual + position + re-skin, NoCollision. **The LIVE
   CARRY-FREEZE is FIXED, hands-on VERIFIED** via the **`!carrying` release-edge gate** in `local_streams.cpp`
   (`else if (g_lastHeldProp && !coop::trash_channel::IsCarrying(g_lastHeldEid))`) — the client clump UPDATES
   through the carry now (no freeze between E-events). The earlier "carry MIRRORS on a settled join / the
   failure was the JOIN RACE" claim was **WITHDRAWN as FALSE**; the actual release-edge cause was `updateHold`
   PUPPET RECREATION (the `heldActor` ptr changes with `pendingSettle=0`, so a `HasPendingSettle` gate couldn't
   catch it), NOT a contact-re-pile churn — which is why the `carrying && HasPendingSettle` gate
   (`C9F28176`/commit `16ac153f`) FAILED and suppressing the WHOLE carry (`!carrying`) is the fix. **Host
   carries FINE; OTHER props mirror fine.** **NOW FIXED/BUILT this session:** (1)
   carry **JANK — FIXED [V]** (shipped `df158728`): the `key.len=4`→keyless theory was DISPROVEN by bytecode
   (BP `GetKey` returns the FName `"None"` for BOTH `prop_garbageClump_C` and `actorChipPile_C` → the receiver
   already guards `keyW != "None"`→eid at `remote_prop.cpp:403`; keyless was a no-op). REAL root = interp
   PHASE-STALL (`BeginLerpToPose` set `lerpStartMs=nowMs`, `AdvanceLerp` sampled the same `nowMs` → alpha=0
   every new-pose tick at vsync-60). FIX = fixed-delay snapshot interpolation (2 timestamped poses, render
   `nowMs-span` behind, alpha by real timestamps; MTA `CClientVehicle` shape) → carry now SMOOTH (user
   hands-on). (2) proxy **SCALE — BUILT v83, hands-on PENDING** (shipped `df158728`, v82→v83): the prior
   "`PropConvertPayload` has `scaleX/Y/Z`" was WRONG (that was `PropSpawnPayload`); added `scaleX/Y/Z` to
   `PropConvertPayload` (static_assert 100→112) + `GetActorScale3D`/`SetActorScale3D` + `ApplyProxyScale` on
   spawn+reskin; NOT eyeballed yet. (3) **ORPHAN dup — SPLIT by pile origin:** DERIVED (gameplay-born) piles dup
   GONE [V]; ORIGINAL (level-placed) piles STILL dup — root CONFIRMED (code+log): level-piles get an eid+proxy
   but the client's NATIVE level-loaded chipPile is NEVER reconciled away → it COEXISTS with the host's proxy
   (the sweep is BLIND to natives). (Supersedes the "eid-resolve race / `isProxy=0` spawn-fresh" theory.) FIX
   (NOT built): DESTROY the native at proxy-spawn (NOT adopt; exact ~1cm match; graceful on 0, exact-or-skip on
   >1); a read-only PILE-PROBE shipped (`29069f05`, `remote_prop_spawn.cpp:355`). (4) the **`simulateDrop`
   throw-velocity FLIP is DEAD — REPLACED by carry/flight stream-continuity** (shipped `136ed779`): BOTH the
   `simulateDrop` thunk AND `dropGrabObject` thunk fired ZERO across 7 grab/release cycles (the clump release
   uses NEITHER verb — the clump rides `grabbing_actor`, the PHC handle) though the same Func-thunk facility
   fired all run; verb-detection ABANDONED. PIVOT: the release-edge `!carrying`-SKIP branch now CONTINUES
   streaming `g_lastHeldProp`'s pose under E while it is a LIVE garbageClump (the post-release flight,
   `IsLive`-gated); the client's fixed-delay interp shows the arc; it ends when the clump re-piles. Hands-on
   PENDING; the dead `dropGrabObject` thunk to be retired RULE 2 next. **Dead ends:** **Option 1** (`8bc797ef`,
   `SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false)` on the held clump) BUILT + FAILED — the live host BP re-arms hit-notify.
   **Option 2 (DISPROVEN by bytecode, NOT pending):** the `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate is DEAD — `holdPlayer`
   (`@0x0240`) is set ONCE on grab (`actorChipPile.json` @8492) and NEVER cleared in any BP, so it cannot mark
   "released." (CLOSE-B latch + land-settle SHIPPED `65AD883A` — correct, not the freeze cause.) The 3-verdict
   discriminator / health-poll / serial-check plan is DROPPED (moot). Design + AS-BUILT:
   `research/findings/votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`; the carry root + fix (the
   canonical doc): `research/findings/votv-chippile-carry-churn-holdplayer-gate-2026-06-22.md`.
4. **STATUS (2026-06-23): the items this roadmap listed are SHIPPED.** carry-freeze + carry-JANK FIXED
   [V hands-on take-30/32]; throw arc + ROTATION + Z-height [V]; the level-pile native-destroy [V harness];
   proxy SCALE AS-BUILT; the client-grab FULL CHAIN (recognition camera-cone + carry stream + throw)
   AS-BUILT + [V harness] v85 (HEAD `29353191`). **The NEXT (greenlight) is now the `garbageCollider`-analog
   SHAPE component** on the proxy (occlusion-correct aim + movement-block — the camera cone ignores walls, the
   proxy is still walk-through); the WHOOSH cue; retire the dead `dropGrabObject` thunk (RULE 2); the
   `event_dispatch_trash.cpp` extraction. (The "suppress-native" client plan is RETIRED, RULE 2 — recognition
   is the camera cone.)

**DEPLOYED: `BB94A120A969A51E` (proto v85) = HEAD `29353191`** — the client-grab FULL CHAIN (camera-cone
recognition + the host-auth `TrashCarryPose` stream + throw, [V harness]), on top of the phase-1 trash proxy (incl. the Movable
visibility fix), the CLOSE-B latch + land-settle (`65AD883A`), the **`!carrying` release-edge gate** (the
CARRY-FREEZE FIX), the **carry JANK fix** (fixed-delay snapshot interp, `df158728`) + **proxy SCALE v83**
(`df158728`), the **throw arc flight-stream** (`136ed779`), and the read-only **PILE-PROBE** (`29069f05`),
folding in the s38 thunk re-pile + sound fix. The proxy's **derived dup-fix + visibility + the live
clump CARRY-FREEZE + the carry JANK are hands-on confirmed**; **proxy SCALE is BUILT v83 (hands-on pending),
the throw arc is the flight-stream (hands-on pending), and the ORIGINAL (level-placed) pile dup is SPLIT off
(native-coexistence root confirmed, native-destroy fix not built)** — option 1 FAILED + option 2 (the
`holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate) is DISPROVEN by bytecode (`holdPlayer` never cleared); see the Status above +
the canonical finding `research/findings/votv-chippile-carry-churn-holdplayer-gate-2026-06-22.md`. The earlier `8bc797ef`
(HEAD `70d28df4`, option 1), `70f1f04b` (HEAD `7f1b29ba`) proxy build, `BA79E705` (HEAD `fea04c26`, the thunk
re-pile + sound fix), `C7030D00` adopt-bind baseline, the FAILED s05/06 morph, and the s07 morph-V2 are all
superseded by 08 (the 07 doc is archived).

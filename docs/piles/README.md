## TL;DR — read this first

- **A pile is `actorChipPile_C`.** It is KEYLESS and has **NO cross-peer identity** of any
  kind. Bytecode-verified on the cooked pak (see `re-artifacts/`): no Key field, `setKey()`
  is a no-op the BP discards, `gatherDataFromKey` hardcodes `gather=false`, and a pile
  persists as a `primitivesData` record (class+transform+chipType) that loads by
  **destroy-all-int_primitive + fresh POSITIONAL respawn**. The only handle a pile can have
  across peers is a HOST-MINTED eid the coop layer assigns and streams.
- **The recurring bug is a JOIN DUPE** (the client ends with 2 of each pile) **+ an
  interaction dupe** (the client spamming E accumulates local-only clumps).
- **A working scheme existed (~June 12-13, committed in the June-10 batch `77225106`):
  "stale save → reconcile".** The client loaded the host's stale `.sav` (so it had its own
  copy of every pile), the host streamed a keyless eid per pile, and a **reconcile**
  (adopt-by-position at the snapshot bracket + a divergence sweep for residue) bound the
  client's OWN pile actor onto the host eid — one actor, no dupe. See [01-HISTORY.md](01-HISTORY.md).
- **What broke it:** a long chain of "improvements" (live-save switch → position-bind seed →
  death-watch → reaper → thin-client doom → save-strip) progressively replaced the
  adopt-by-position reconcile with fresh-spawn-mirror + destroy-the-original mechanisms that
  never converge. The latest (save-strip) was REVERTED 2026-06-20.
- **The plan:** restore the adopt-by-position reconcile (it is intact at committed HEAD
  `1272b0a3`'s `EnsurePileBindIndex`) and fix the interaction dupe at its real root (the
  freed-mirror re-stream trigger). See [03-RESTORATION-PLAN.md](03-RESTORATION-PLAN.md).

## What is a pile, exactly (the engine facts)

| Fact | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Class | `AactorChipPile_C` (+ subclasses `_erie`/`_wetConcrete`/`_leaves`) | `re-artifacts/chipPile.json`, CXXHeaderDump |
| Interfaces | `int_objects_C` + `int_save_C` + `int_primitive_C` | re-artifacts |
| Identity | **NONE.** No Key field; `setKey()` writes a transient frame nothing reads | `re-artifacts/chipPile.json` (getData/getKey hardcode "None") |
| Save (objectsData) | `getData` writes a key="None" struct_save record @ objectsData | `re-artifacts/saveObjects_dump.txt` |
| Save (primitivesData) | `getPrimitiveData` writes class+transform+chipType-json @ primitivesData (the LOAD-authoritative array) | `re-artifacts/mainGamemode.json` (Save Primitives) |
| Load | `loadObjects` spawns from objectsData, then "Load Primitives" DESTROYS all int_primitive and RESPAWNS positionally from primitivesData | `re-artifacts/loadObjects_dump.txt` |
| Grab/morph | grabbing a pile runs the BP `toClump()` → spawns a `prop_garbageClump_C` (the carried "ball") | `findings/votv-chippile-clump-morph-RE-2026-05-27.md` |
| Why no save-strip | the save-loaded pile IS what the coop layer adopts as the mirror; stripping it leaves the client with NO piles | session 32 hands-on (this folder) |

## The two bugs, precisely

1. **JOIN DUPE** — on join the client loads the host save (its own ~870 piles) AND the host
   streams a mirror eid per pile. If the mirror **adopts onto** the client's pile → 1 actor,
   correct. If it **fresh-spawns a separate mirror** (or the doom that should delete the
   original never fires) → 2 actors = the dupe. The recent stack fresh-spawns + relies on a
   doom that wedges (`liveMirrors < expected`, never converges). Full RCA:
   [02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md](02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md) §1.
2. **INTERACTION DUPE (E-spam)** — the join's same-world "shadow-drain" (a mass actor purge)
   FREES the host pile-mirror actors; the catalog isn't decremented and the re-stream that
   should re-materialize them is gated behind a purge-episode-EXIT edge that never fires under
   churn → the piles the player walks up to are mirror-UNBOUND → grabbing one mints a
   permanent local-only `prop_garbageClump_C` (eid=0) that no relay suppresses and no doom
   reaps. Full RCA: [02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md](02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md) §2.

## Cross-cutting truth FIRST (read these before the pile-specific docs)

The pile dupe was, at root, a **"which seam expresses this entity?" / "will my hook fire?"** problem.
Those questions are now answered canonically (code-verified, confidence-tagged) in:
- **[../COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md](../COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md)** — every entity's spawn→catch→
  identity→destroy, incl. the chipPile/clump dupe matrix.
- **[../COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md](../COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md)** — VISIBLE vs INVISIBLE dispatch +
  which of our seams can/can't see what (the `init()`-is-`EX_LocalVirtualFunction` fact that killed the
  take-18 Init-POST bet).

These supersede the cross-cutting parts of the pile docs below; 01-04 remain the pile-specific
history/diagnosis/design, and **08 is the CURRENT design** (the host-authoritative trash channel);
**07 is SUPERSEDED + RETIRED** (the morph -- a real hands-on refuted its smoke "VERIFIED" 2026-06-21).

- **[02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md](02-CURRENT-DIAGNOSIS.md)** — the two bugs' root causes, from the

  native-looking pile sync + the anti-patterns we did wrong (the deterministic-placement insight).
- **[08-HOST-AUTH-TRASH-CHANNEL.md](08-HOST-AUTH-TRASH-CHANNEL.md)** — **THE CURRENT DESIGN + AS-BUILT
  (2026-06-21 session 38+, HEAD `1011e512`, proto v82; deployed DLL still `BA79E705`).** Host-authoritative
  trash-entity identity (eid = logical entity), MTA single-syncer + sync-time-context byte. **GRAB
  (pile→clump) = VERIFIED hands-on** via the `InpActEvt_use` PRE seam + the held-edge adopt. **RE-PILE
  (clump→pile) = the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter** (commit `d19ae4d4`,
  `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`): catches the clump's `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred` and converts E onto the EXACT
  spawned pile the same tick — zero proximity, no reaper race (the ~5s vanish-return is gone by construction).
  The thunk DETECTION is VERIFIED (read-only pass agreed ptr-for-ptr with the old death-watch); the CONVERT +
  the triple-grab-cue fix (`fea04c26`) are deployed-pending-hands-on. The proximity death-watch is RETIRED
  (RULE 2). **The s35 "BeginDeferred-POST is observable" link was DISPROVEN** (EX_CallMath → invisible; 0
  host_spawn_watcher fires). **CLIENT mirror of trash = the host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` PROXY —
  phase 1 AS-BUILT (built, NOT smoked, NOT deployed)** (commits `06685a9c` + `1011e512`, `coop/trash_proxy`):
  an `AStaticMeshActor` WE own (NO blueprint, `AddToRoot`, our eid→actor registry, re-skin in place on
  convert) replaces the real self-morphing BP mirror → the client mirror-staleness dup is impossible BY
  CONSTRUCTION (the 3-verdict discriminator / health-poll / serial-check plan is DROPPED as moot). Phase 1 =
  visual + position + re-skin, NoCollision; collision (the `garbageCollider` hull) + the client-grab
  direction are PHASE 2 / Increment 2 (still DESIGN). Design + AS-BUILT:
  `research/findings/votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`. **Read this for the pile
  sync.**

  morph: held-object adopt + PROXIMITY land-watch). Its smoke "VERIFIED" was a FALSE POSITIVE; the real
  hands-on refuted it (proximity false-fires in clusters; client grab never armed). History only — see 08.
- `_archive/05-MORPH-SYNC-DESIGN.md` + `_archive/06-AS-BUILT-sync-mirror.md` — **SUPERSEDED** (the FAILED

## Status (2026-06-21, session 38+; HEAD `1011e512`) — DESIGN → AS-BUILT → VERIFIED

The whole saga below (01–04 + the s21–s33 session-log) converged on **08 — the host-authoritative trash
channel**, which is the CURRENT design + as-built. The day-to-day live state is in the auto-memory
(`MEMORY.md` index + the top `project_session*` entry); this is the durable summary:

1. **GRAB (pile→clump) — VERIFIED hands-on** (`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`) via the `InpActEvt_use` PRE seam + the
   held-edge adopt. Identity is the host-minted eid end-to-end, NO proximity.
2. **RE-PILE (clump→pile) — the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter** (commit `d19ae4d4`,
   `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`): the thunk catches the clump's `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred` and converts E onto
   the EXACT spawned pile the same tick — zero proximity, no reaper race. The thunk DETECTION is **VERIFIED**
   (a read-only pass agreed ptr-for-ptr with the prior proximity death-watch, which is now RETIRED, RULE 2);
   the CONVERT flip + the triple-grab-cue fix (`fea04c26`, the ctx-gate requireCurrentGen split) are
   **AS-BUILT, deployed `BA79E705`, hands-on-PENDING** (the next hands-on confirms a single grab cue + no
   vanish-return). Runbook: `research/handson_runbook_2026-06-21_repile_thunk.md` (take-22).
3. **CLIENT mirror-staleness dup — phase-1 proxy AS-BUILT (built, not smoked), HEAD `1011e512`** (was OPEN).
   The client's mirror of trash is now a host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` we own (NO blueprint,
   `AddToRoot`, our eid→actor registry; re-skin in place on convert) instead of the real self-morphing BP —
   so the staleness dup (a join-mirror going NOT-LIVE within ~10s → fresh-clump spawn + original lingering)
   is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION. Commits `06685a9c` + `1011e512` (the hotfix: CRITICAL per-slot-disconnect
   leak). Phase 1 = visual + position + re-skin, NoCollision. Audit `a249b005`: CRITICAL-1 fixed; HIGH-1
   (ToClump-beats-spawn), HIGH-2 (clump MATERIAL swap), MEDIUM-1 (StaticLoadObject + Cube fallback) + the
   km-walk lerp + reliable carry-end release STILL PENDING before the smoke. The 3-verdict discriminator /
   health-poll / serial-check plan is DROPPED (moot). Design + AS-BUILT:
   `research/findings/votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`.
4. **NEXT (DESIGN, NOT built):** the phase-1 proxy smoke (the dup-gone + km-walk gate) once deployed; then
   grab-via-thunk (closes the eid=0 adopt-miss gap); then proxy PHASE 2 (collision — the `garbageCollider`
   hull) + Increment 2 (the client-grab direction — suppress-native + GrabIntent → host executes on
   puppet-N; proto v83).

**DEPLOYED: `BA79E705` (proto v82) = HEAD `fea04c26`** — the thunk re-pile + the sound fix, pending the
hands-on confirmation. **The phase-1 trash proxy (HEAD `1011e512`) is BUILT but NOT yet deployed** (the user
is mid-A+B hands-on, so the deploy slots are in use). The earlier `C7030D00` adopt-bind baseline + the FAILED
s05/06 morph + the s07 morph-V2 are all superseded by 08 (the 07 doc is archived).

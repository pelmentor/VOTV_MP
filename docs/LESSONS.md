# LESSONS — what VOTV_MP has learned the hard way

The single browsable ledger of durable lessons + **DIG-RULE** lessons. Each row is a takeaway, a
"look here FIRST next time" pointer where one applies, and a link to the full `memory/` file (the
authoritative detail). This complements — does not replace — `MEMORY.md` (the terse auto-memory index
loaded each session): `MEMORY.md` is the machine index; this is the human-readable, categorized digest.

**Maintained by `/documentize`** (Step 3.5): every sweep ADDS the session's new lessons and RECONCILES
existing rows for staleness (a row whose cited symbol/path moved is fixed or archived — a lesson pointing
at a dead symbol sends the next session on a worse dig than no lesson at all). A lesson earns a row only
if it saves a FUTURE dig.

> Links use the `memory/` slug: `memory/<slug>.md`.

## 0. The DIG-RULE (why this file exists)

**When a dig produces a hard-won measured fact, record it as a durable lesson so a future session reads it
instead of re-excavating the same hole.** Born because the project dug the same place twice (rock F2,
2026-07-08/09) and the user made it a rule. Two faces:

- **MAP-ALL-WIRE-EVENTS** — when a synced entity does not APPEAR / STICK / flickers / resets on a peer,
  MAP the full set of wire events ONE action emits (both peers, tick order) BEFORE building any fix; a
  later same-key event can silently UNDO an earlier one. `memory/feedback_map_all_wire_events_before_fixing_missing_sync.md`
- **PROBE-DON'T-GUESS** — MEASURE the root with a read-only probe before building a fix; a design stays
  provisional until the probe discriminates it. `memory/feedback_probe_dont_guess_rule.md`
- **VERIFY, don't re-derive** — recalled memory reflects what was true WHEN WRITTEN; verify a cited
  file/function/offset/flag still exists before recommending it (this is why staleness reconciliation is
  part of every sweep).

---

## 1. How to work (process / working agreements)

- **Run `/qf` (up to 15 rounds) BEFORE any non-trivial implementation + when planning new changes** —
  default to it; the adversarial pass is where crutches/wrong-layer/un-measured-assumption get caught
  before cementing. `memory/feedback_qf_before_implementation.md`
- **The /qf critic has a SELECTIVE-TRUST blind spot** — it interrogates claims individually + accepts the
  primary's answers as settled, so "trust a source for X, distrust it for Y" slips a whole pass. Skill
  patched 2026-07-13 (source-consistency / cross-answer / undone-measurement angles); still check manually.
  `memory/feedback_qf_selective_trust_blindspot.md`
- **The /qf critic escalates WITHIN THE FRAME it is handed** — so a MIGRATION design (repoint/rebind/re-key)
  that migrates the ONE identity map the brief names, while a PARALLEL map keyed on the same entity finalizes
  late, slips a whole multi-round pass (11 rounds + a "that holds" missed the host-only KerfurId table). When
  a design migrates identity, ENUMERATE every map that keys on the entity + prove the op updates or gates ALL
  of them. Skill patched 2026-07-13 nite (IDENTITY-MAP-COMPLETENESS angle + brief-enumeration + convergence
  bar). `memory/feedback_qf_enumerate_identity_maps_on_migration.md`
- **The /qf critic inherits the primary's BRIEF as ground truth (blind-spot #3: CARRIED-FRAMING)** — the
  fresh-per-round critic sees only what the primary wrote, and the primary writes its own brief, so a
  load-bearing NOUN it introduced as an inference and hardened by repetition ("the existing two-phase arm
  record" — actually FOUR distinct converge mechanisms) launders into an apparent fact every fresh critic
  reads blind. Worst in `/qf N` auto-loop (N self-summarized briefs, no external check). Fix: tag facts by
  PROVENANCE (measured-artifact vs carried-framing) + code-verify the 1-2 nouns the design hangs on before
  convergence + SURFACE to the user after any material REFRAME instead of auto-continuing (the user, holding
  the real history + raw artifacts, is the only party who catches framing drift, retroactive-foundation-
  invalidation, and cross-artifact synthesis). Skill patched 2026-07-14 (FRAMING-PROVENANCE angle + brief
  provenance-tag + reframe-surface + carried-primitive convergence bar).
  `memory/feedback_qf_challenge_carried_framing_not_just_the_frame.md`
- **A NEGATIVE grep is only evidence if the pattern can match a KNOWN-POSITIVE line** — before concluding
  "0 matches -> never happens / mechanism dead / gate clean", prove the pattern CAN match the positive case
  (grep one real hit; check the log line even CONTAINS the field you filter on). A query structurally blind
  to its target returns 0 and the null reads as PROOF. Worst kind: not a case that never arose, but one that
  arose EVERY time and was invisible to the query. Cost 2026-07-14: `grep 'grab_hook\[destroy-seam\].*kerfur'`
  =0 "proved" the destroy-seam never fires for kerfur (the line prints actor/key/eid, NO class) -> declared
  `TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy` dead -> nearly RULE-2-deleted the guard sitting on bug1's actual relay.
  Corollary: when ONE negative-grep turns out blind, RE-RUN the audit on every other "0 fires" in the
  inventory. 2nd instance 2026-07-16: asserted "the master server isn't in the repo" from a `find -type d
  -iname '*master*'` — blind, because it's a FILE `tools/coop_master_server.py` (679 LOC stdlib) a dir
  search can't match. Search by the artifact's real shape (`glob **/*.py`, a signature string like
  `/v1/host`), not a guessed folder. `memory/lesson_negative_grep_verify_against_known_positive.md`
- **Before changing a FUNCTION's behavior, enumerate ALL its call sites + state what each expects; before
  SUBTRACTING an output at a seam, enumerate every other producer/consumer at that seam** — acting on an
  incomplete map of what you're touching is ONE recurring root with many faces (a "mechanism" that is N
  mechanisms; a converge fn with an unenumerated 3rd/4th caller; a "suppressor" that is 3 coordinating
  broadcasters; a proxy criterion that only correlates with the real fact). A subtraction breaks unenumerated
  consumers SILENTLY (no error). Prefer the DIRECT fact over a PROXY. Cost 2026-07-14: captured-B wired into
  `ConvergeAfterConversion` without mapping its 4 callers (the POLL death-watch was the one that duped); fixed
  by enumerating the seam's 3 PropSpawn broadcasters FIRST -> "track-but-don't-broadcast" (remove the output,
  keep the tracked-flag contract the others coordinate on). `memory/feedback_enumerate_call_sites_before_changing_behavior.md`
- **"per rule 1" = full green light** for the root-cause fix in its complete form (incl. hard
  architectural change). Don't scope down, don't ask "is this too big". `memory/feedback_no_crutch_questions_act_autonomously.md`
- **No design/architect AGENTS** — design yourself from code + docs + MTA; search + audit agents OK. `memory/feedback_no_design_architect_agents.md`
- **Claude OWNS every mechanical chore** (ini flags, grep/log-read, build, deploy) — never hand them to the
  user; the user does only in-game actions. `memory/feedback_claude_owns_all_mechanical_chores.md`
- **User ON the PC = USER tests**; Claude launches only user-AWAY + green-lit. `memory/feedback_user_tests_claude_prepares_ground.md`
- **Ask in PLAIN TEXT, never the AskUserQuestion UI.** `memory/feedback_ask_in_text_not_question_ui.md`
- **Never assert a VOTV game-domain fact from assumption** — verify vs SDK/bp_reflect/wiki FIRST. `memory/feedback_verify_game_domain_facts.md`
- **RE all related blueprints STATICALLY before any runtime probe.** `memory/feedback_re_blueprints_before_probes.md`
- **Commit autonomously at verified checkpoints; still ASK before PUSH.** `memory/feedback_commit_autonomously.md`
- **Never retire a load-bearing fix on an unverified theory.** `memory/feedback_verify_before_retiring_a_fix.md`
- **SAME bug after 2+ targeted fixes = the patch LEVEL is wrong; the root is architectural** — stop patching, re-root. `memory/feedback_recurring_bug_is_architectural.md`
- **A cross-cutting axis has ONE owner** — handlers CAPTURE, never apply (anti-smear). `memory/feedback_one_owner_order_axis.md`
- **Fix a mirror-identity race WORKING first, generalize only after N>=3.** `memory/feedback_fix_then_generalize_mirror_identity.md`
- **Every source FOLDER = ONE domain concept; no catch-all names.** `memory/feedback_folder_per_domain_concept_rule.md`
- **RULE 2 does NOT apply to probes/diagnostics/tools** (they may stay). `memory/feedback_rule2_exempts_probes_diagnostics_tools.md`
- **Test/probe flags live in `votv-coop.ini [dev]`, NOT bats/env.** `memory/feedback_test_flags_in_ini_not_bats_or_env.md`
- **`docs/piles/` is the LIVING pile KB** — mark DESIGN vs AS-BUILT vs VERIFIED. `memory/feedback_docs_piles_living_knowledge_base.md`
- **A diagnostic probe's built-in comparability/quiescent tag is only as good as its DERIVED inputs** —
  validate EACH gate input against the codebase's MEASURED field-behavior before trusting the tag; a wrong
  input silently mislabels samples (a clean diff on mislabeled data is worse than none). Two inputs broke
  the desk_diag `q=Y` tag (game-jittered knobs → always-N; unchecked active-filter integration → q=Y
  mid-ramp). Prefer clean DISCRETE state over float-delta heuristics; first check the log = do `q=Y`
  samples cluster at the real pauses. `memory/lesson_comparability_tag_inputs_need_measured_validation.md`
- **A handed-down measurement / build / on-disk noun is a CLAIM, not a fact** — verify it with grep
  (SDK+reflection+src) and `git status` BEFORE building on it, whoever asserts it (user, critic,
  prior-turn summary) and however confidently/repeatedly; **re-assertion AFTER a grep-refutation is a
  STRONGER red flag, not weaker.** Born 2026-07-15: four consecutive fabricated nouns
  (`serverStorageComp`/`ELEMENT`/`getAll`/`getServerStorage`, all 0 hits) + a "ship it" for a build
  `git status` showed never existed — caught every time by grep+git, never by reasoning.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/feedback_verify_handed_down_measurement_before_building.md`

## 2. Join-window identity & the DUP-prone zone (measure before touching)

- **A client grab/drop of a host-owned keyed prop = a MOVE with TWO same-key halves** (SPAWN author + a
  co-fired grab-hook DESTROY); the DESTROY is usually the killer. *Look FIRST:* the destroy-seam, not the
  spawn author. `memory/lesson_client_keyed_prop_move_two_wire_halves.md`
- **A host OnSpawn log line != VISIBLE** — check the immediate same-tick OnDestroy (destroy-by-key kills
  the newest). `memory/lesson_onspawn_log_not_proof_check_immediate_destroy.md`
- **REUSE the proven author (with its gates), don't raw-reimplement** — a raw MarkPropElement broke the
  E-grab decline. `memory/lesson_reuse_proven_author_not_raw_reimpl.md`
- **A join reconcile that DESTROYS local actors needs a quiescence gate + caps.** `memory/feedback_join_reconcile_sweep_safety.md`
- **An op applied BEFORE the state it reads is ready recurs** — gate/defer (snapshot-before-state-ready). `memory/feedback_snapshot_before_state_ready.md`
- **chipPiles persist in `primitivesData`; off-kerfurs in `objectsData`** (different save lanes). `memory/lesson_chippile_saved_in_primitivesData_not_objectsData.md`
- **DELIVERY-axis: join DELIVERY vs IDENTITY are separate; ONE owner = `prop_snapshot`.** `memory/feedback_deliver_missing_owner_delivery_axis.md`
- **Check the EXISTING barrier's ANCHOR before building compensation layers** — the two-authority
  join seam (4 roots, 4 layers, 3 days) was ONE mis-anchored edge: the v56 gate/replay WAS the MTA
  join barrier, but ClientWorldReady fired at "world up" (seconds before the loadObjects tail
  settled). *Look FIRST* on a window/race class's SECOND compensation layer: does a READY edge
  exist, what PREDICATE fires it ("world up" != "world settled"), is a stronger client-local
  signal already trusted elsewhere (the doom sweep's probe was). Moving an edge beats compensating
  for it. `memory/lesson_check_existing_barrier_anchor_before_compensating.md`
- **Harness TimelineThread call sites: an Arm() stays ATOMICS-ONLY (or Post to the GT)** —
  DriveMenuModeJoinWorldBoot runs OFF the game thread (harness.cpp:285-288); extending a directly-
  called Arm to touch plain GT-owned state is a silent data race (2026-07-12 audit CRITICAL: 8
  fields + a std::string; fixed `7847021e` via an atomic request flag consumed by the GT ticker +
  UE_ASSERT_GAME_THREAD on GT-only entries). *Look FIRST:* the caller's thread — grep the enclosing
  harness function for TimelineThread comments / Post-and-wait siblings.
  `memory/lesson_harness_timeline_thread_arm_sites_atomics_only.md`
- **In-episode wire expressions WERE provisional — the JOIN BARRIER removed the window (2026-07-12
  `bbf91f39`, SUPERSEDED AT SOURCE):** ClientWorldReady now announces at load-tail quiescence
  (`coop/session/world_load_episode` probe latch — the MTA INITIAL_DATA_STREAM shape), so no wire
  prop expression can arrive mid-churn; the capture/revalidation/netting machinery (takes 1-4) was
  RULE-2 deleted. The measured record (fresh mirrors churn-killed ~2 s; converge targets recreated
  only from save-WORLD records; phase replay inverting a destroy->spawn pair; doom judges LAST)
  stays the FIRST read for a prop bug in the DEGRADED mode ("latching DEGRADED" in the client log)
  or the TRAVEL window (no travel-start gate yet). *Look FIRST:* client log — "load-tail QUIESCED"
  must precede "ClientWorldReady announced"; NO [SPAWN-DEFER] lines exist anymore (one appearing =
  someone resurrected the dead machinery); per-doom cls/key/loc lines + the dead-row tripwire still
  live in the sweep. `memory/lesson_join_window_wire_expression_provisional.md`
- **VOTV's OWN save ships DUPLICATE interactable Keys** (85 trashBitsPile_C across 4 keys — save-born
  clone families; the 06-24 sweep silently doomed "80 trashBitsPile" for weeks). Key uniqueness is OUR
  invariant: the HOST re-keys duplicates at enroll (MarkPropElement, the one owner; GT-gated setKey;
  dead incumbent = churn recreate inheriting identity). Take-4: the `2fefd161` re-key was INERT (162x
  "setKey not found" — trashBitsPile is actor_save_C lineage; repaired by the SuperStruct-climbing
  resolver, `460da7e4`). *Look FIRST:* host-log "KEY-UNIQUENESS ... re-keyed -> 'rk_'" SUCCESS burst
  ("re-key FAILED" = the authority is NOT working); same-key multiplicity histogram in the adopt burst.
  `memory/lesson_votv_save_ships_duplicate_interactable_keys.md`
- **MirrorManager\<Prop\> MIXES census LOCAL rows with wire rows (one actor can carry BOTH)** — an
  actor->eid reverse meaning "established cross-peer identity" must filter `IsMirror()`
  (`ResolveMirrorEidByActor(wireMirrorOnly)`), else it kills the Gap-I-1 divergent-key dedup.
  *Look FIRST:* mirror_manager.h "MIXES" block. `memory/lesson_prop_mirror_manager_mixes_local_and_wire_rows.md`
- **A NEW generic catch/express lane must inherit EVERY existing owner boundary; "UNTRACKED = mine"
  premises die when per-tick claimers ship** — spawn_authority Inc-1's seam drain (07-10) lacked the
  kerfur OWNER BOUNDARY the census lane already carried → the 5 Hz kerfur converge lost every race,
  silently released the dead NPC, no KerfurConvert → the take-8 five-for-five toggle dupe. Fix = kerfur
  FIRST REFUSAL at the express chokepoints (TryAdoptFreshKerfurProp: UNTRACKED + dead-NPC-watch match,
  event-driven at the spawn edge; the poll stays as backstop), `ded3f793`. *Look FIRST:* a poll-class
  "converge found nothing" WARN right after a `spawn-seam adopted`/generic express of the same
  class+position = the race; when adding a lane, DIFF its gates against every sibling lane.
  `memory/lesson_new_generic_lane_must_inherit_owner_boundaries.md`
- **ChildActorComponent children are OUTSIDE the world-object universe** — a kerfur eye cam
  (prop_camera_good_C) passes every "world prop" filter (keyed, Aprop lineage, live) but the game's
  own rule is `Aprop_C::ignoreSave = ignoreSav || IsChildActor()` (prop_base bytecode): its Key is
  per-peer random, cross-peer identity impossible in principle. Enrolling/broadcasting them = floating
  CCTV mirrors on the joiner + the joiner's own eye cams doomed (take-7). And a SEND-side exclusion
  must gate EVERY payload builder — the steady re-seed express bypassed enrollment (elementId=0 keyed
  payloads) while the gated destroy seam made its orphans PERMANENT (audit CRITICAL). *Look FIRST:*
  `ue_wrap::engine::IsChildActor` (six consult surfaces, `c93617be`); any NEW prop enumeration must
  consult it. `memory/lesson_child_actors_excluded_from_world_object_universe.md`
- **Identity-critical log lines carry cls+key+loc (USER RULE)** — a class histogram alone makes
  per-entity RCA impossible; cold paths only, never at the POST-native destroy seam (PendingKill),
  throttle mass arms. `memory/feedback_identity_logs_carry_key_and_loc.md`

## 3. Sync architecture (owners, routers, lifecycle)

- **A claim-gated intent lane must cover EVERY entry surface of the device.** v111 routed desk knob
  intents over the claimed-occupant lane, but the claim engages only on the intComs `activeInterface`
  edge — the download unit's WORLD-SPACE buttons never raise it, so the lane was structurally dead for
  the unit it was built for (bugs 1/2/3 of the 2026-07-16 hands-on = ONE axis fact). *Look FIRST:*
  enumerate the device's verb surfaces (widget focus / world-space press / hold-E / overlap) and grep the
  claim writer for the edge each raises. `memory/lesson_claim_gated_intent_lane_must_cover_every_entry_surface.md`
- **A mirrored float feeding a native `>= X` latch needs EXACT-SNAP, not an asymptote.** v111 BUG-4:
  SimInterp's window reopens on every 10 Hz packet -> never snaps to exactly 1.0 -> sub-ulp freeze just
  under the detector latch -> the client's unsuppressed native block re-crosses the threshold every frame
  -> stuck beep. Check (a) the interp actually emits exactly X under packet cadence, (b) the local
  crossing side-effect is suppressed/idempotent. **v112 corollary: the exact-snap must be PER-CHANNEL**
  (a whole-vector skip never fires while any channel moves — decoded accrues every packet), and a
  DISCRETE channel (0/1 flag) never rides the ease at all — snap on arrival. **v115b BOUNDARY:
  exact-snap does NOT extend to EVENT-FIRING machines — the ping FSM's stage transitions are
  `==1.0` checks whose consequences are events/spawns/append-text; snapping values onto any
  un-parked machine fires them locally = double events. Such machines: single-author only.**
  *Look FIRST:* desk_sim_sync.cpp SimInterp (v112 per-channel).
  `memory/lesson_mirrored_threshold_latch_needs_exact_snap.md`
- **connected()-gated poll lanes EAT pre-connect edges — every such lane owes a connect-edge seed
  from GROUND TRUTH** (v115b audit CRIT-1: a SOLO host's ping edge was absorbed by the unwired
  baseline → a mid-ping joiner got no FSM-hold; desk_input gates its BOOKKEEPING on connected()
  while device_occupancy gates only the SEND — two adjacent lanes, opposite gating, one silent
  hole). Seed in ConnectReplayForSlot by reading the ENGINE state, never the baseline; never
  clobber a live wire attribution. *Look FIRST:* `desk_input_sync::SeedPingAttributionFromMachine`
  + `desk_snd_fx::QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot`.
  `memory/lesson_connected_gated_poll_needs_connect_seed.md`
- **Edge-authority polls: classify wire-replay transients by STATE PREDICATE, not flags/timers**
  (v115b root-3: the catch replay's ResetDownloadMachine made the dish mesh transiently invalid
  ~24 s → the ARM/DISARM edge poll broadcast a false DISARM that stomped the fresh catch. A
  one-shot flag loses the legit ARM on fast respawns; a timer is a guess. The predicate: mesh
  down + signalData LIVE = re-init window — a real disarm deletes signalData FIRST). *Look
  FIRST:* `dish_sync.cpp HostArmPoll` reinitWindow.
  `memory/lesson_edge_authority_poll_wire_transient_state_predicate.md`
- **Presser-authored STATE broadcasts, never intent lanes, for EX-invisible verbs.** The verb has
  ALREADY run locally (incl. RNG rolls + id mints) before any seam can see it — "intent -> host
  executes" cannot exist; detect the local change (PE seam > raw-field poll > VM-bracket dirty-mark),
  broadcast field-granular deltas, receivers apply+prime in the same GT task, host relays EXCLUDING
  the originator (an echo reverts a newer local value = the eaten-scroll race). *Look FIRST:* the
  all-units design doc + coop/desk_input_sync (the v112 template).
  `memory/lesson_presser_authored_state_not_intent_for_invisible_verbs.md`
- **The desk's `active_*` unit toggles are SETTER-EVENT-managed; `powerChanged` is FUSED.** Raw field
  writes leave mirror hums/lights dead (half of bug 3); the only native setter (powerChanged, 5 bools)
  runs EVERY unit's block incl. an UNCONDITIONAL stopSound — replicate each field's effects reflected
  instead. *Look FIRST:* ue_wrap/console_desk.cpp ApplyActiveToggleEffects + uber [1113-1156].
  `memory/lesson_active_toggles_setter_events_powerchanged_fused.md`
- **Follow MTA architecture when possible** (vendored `reference/mtasa-blue/`). `memory/feedback_follow_mta_architecture.md`
- **A new `ReliableKind` wires in THREE places** — check the router checklist. `memory/feedback_reliablekind_router_checklist.md`
- **Host TRACKING/enroll gates on HOSTING, never `connected()`.** `memory/lesson_tracking_gates_on_hosting_not_connected.md`
- **EVERY session-end path runs the FULL teardown fanout** — AND session-scoped UI (chat feed/input/
  bubbles/nameplate/voice_panel) dies at the FLEE funnel (`FleeToMainMenu`), NOT `DisconnectAll` (which
  also runs on the HOST keeping its world, so it must not clear on-screen UI). **A RESET alone is not
  enough if a per-tick EDGE DETECTOR re-fires AFTER it:** `session.Stop()` flips slots -> the next
  `event_feed::Update` re-Pushes "Host left the game" into the just-cleared feed (client self-quit,
  `e02343c4`) -> also disarm the producer (`SuppressPeerLeaveEdges`). *Look FIRST:* net_pump.cpp:184
  (chat-leak-into-menu, 2026-07-15). `memory/lesson_every_session_end_path_full_teardown_fanout.md`
- **A host-auth FROZEN mirror displaying slightly stale = a TRANSPORT+CADENCE bug, NOT authority.** Fix
  the refresh (periodic UNRELIABLE absolute snapshot at display cadence, pose-stream pattern); do NOT hand
  the client simulation + clamp it back (lateral/regression + a per-broadcast site-list). Clock design F
  (v110, `2dde3e16`): client stays frozen mirror, clock streams `ClockPose=37`. *Look FIRST:* smooth-sun
  needs advancing `totalTime` through `ReceiveTick` which fires every `newMinute`/`newHour` -> that path
  is gated on enumerating those consumers. `memory/lesson_frozen_mirror_desync_is_transport_not_authority.md`
- **`subsystems::Install` is called EVERY net_pump tick (idempotent contract)** — net_pump.cpp:1014, "one-
  shot install ... idempotent"; each sub-Install MUST latch its noisy/expensive work or it re-runs per
  frame (desk_diag ENABLED banner ~37k/session, `2de202ed`). *Look FIRST:* add a `static bool` latch to
  any new Install that logs/allocates/hooks/resolves. `memory/lesson_subsystems_install_runs_every_tick_must_latch.md` (SHARPENED v120: a success-only latch whose FAILED retry re-runs FindClass = a 60 Hz pre-world array-walk bomb — put every resolve retry behind a throttled gate or a cached resolver)
- **Every client-side SUPPRESSION is a LOAN, not a purchase (N=3: weather 06-11, serverbox 07-09,
  garbage_sync 07-10).** Persistent-state neutralizations (tick-disable, field-zero, TimeScale=0,
  suppress flags) need an EXPLICIT OnDisconnect restore; fn-body PRE-cancels SELF-restore ONLY when
  gated on `s->running()`/`connected()` — a bare `role()==Client` gate keeps suppressing in SOLO play
  forever (Stop never resets cfg_.role). ADDED 2026-07-16: the restore must RE-LOOKUP a live
  instance (never PE-dispatch on the cached parked ptr = UAF; caught twice — serverbox 07-10,
  dish tickers 07-16 audit F1). *Look FIRST:* name the restore mechanism in the SAME commit;
  census: grep bare role-gates without running(). `memory/lesson_suppression_needs_paired_restore_or_running_gate.md`
- **Killing a BP latent frame-loop by clearing its gate flag exits at the loop HEAD — the whole
  arrival/END chain is skipped and stale** (dish: looping motor cues stay Active forever;
  `activeDishes[i]` stuck true → the OnKeyDown ping gate blocks that peer permanently); and
  CO-WRITING a live loop's component never oscillates — it STARVES the loop's arrival check
  indefinitely (it re-reads fresh, steps toward its LOCAL target, checks its own post-write value).
  Park = kill + explicit end-chain cleanup; mirror only onto a DEAD loop. COROLLARY 07-16: a
  one-shot sweep can't outrun a PENDING latent (movePow re-arms audio at the delayed resume,
  AFTER the sweep) — pair the kill with a standing 1 Hz reconciler over a watch-set
  (dish_sync ClientParkLatch as-built). *Look FIRST:*
  `votv-dish-impl-RE-2026-07-16.md` §2-3. `memory/lesson_bp_latent_loop_kill_skips_end_chain.md`
- **`init_objectRenderer` (inside every formDownload) pre-DELETES the previous display actor then
  SPAWNS a fresh one (class from the signal DT row)** — back-to-back formDownload CONVERGES (safe
  to overwrite an arm with host values); but a field-zeroing un-arm (`ResetDownloadMachine`)
  leaves the rendered signal object ALIVE — the native un-arm chain calls `deleteSignalActor` and
  a mirrored disarm must too (as-built: DishArm=99 armed=0 apply). *Look FIRST:*
  `votv-dish-L4-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-16.md` D4. `memory/lesson_objectrenderer_init_spawns_display_actor_converges.md`
- **Wire packets: check `kMaxPacketBytes`=256 / `kMaxReliablePayload`=228 FIRST; quantize u16.**
  The L4 draft shipped 312/388 B structs before reading the caps; the shipped pattern = u16
  centidegrees (`QuantDeg`, 0.01 deg vs the 1.0-deg native tolerance) + u16/65535 scalars →
  full-24-dish packets fit (168/196/100 B). Oversize-by-design = the chunking precedents, not a
  bigger datagram. *Look FIRST:* protocol.h QuantDeg + the static_asserts.
  `memory/lesson_wire_packet_caps_check_first_quantize_u16.md`
- **A CLIENT-born Aprop_C crosses at the SPAWN seam, never "at place"** — client spawns don't
  broadcast (local ghost) and a plain drop/throw fires NO FinishSpawn (only pocket→place does);
  the reusable seam = the F2 client FinishSpawn drain (Init already minted the NewGuid key) →
  class-gated intent → `HostSpawnPlacedProp` born-ASLEEP → the held-prop stream drives it →
  adopt-by-key. First instance: ReelEjectIntent=104 (L7 v114 `ba8ce297`). *Look FIRST:*
  `votv-tape-caddy-L7-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-17.md` D4 + prop_drop_intent.cpp.
  `memory/lesson_client_prop_birth_crosses_at_spawn_seam_not_place.md`
- **A save-scalar birth channel must be filled at EVERY birth/author path** (live express + join
  snapshot + container extract + BOTH client intent kinds) via ONE shared per-class reader —
  missing one path = a CDO-default mirror re-broadcast as truth (the L7 correctness CRITICAL:
  pocket→place respawned a blank tape). NEXT class with per-prop save state = the L5 drive
  payload. *Look FIRST:* prop.h savedScalar block; grep `ReadSavedScalarForClass` for the fill
  set. `memory/lesson_saved_scalar_birth_channel_covers_every_birth_path.md`
- **When the prop's own refresh verb re-applies `SetActorTickEnabled`, a client-tick PARK is
  un-holdable — ship the host exact-snap CORRECTOR instead** (valid only for RNG-free,

- **When a release VERB can't be caught, STREAM THROUGH the state** — and when the observed state has
  its own POST-release dynamics (the desk cursor's focus-UNGATED glide integrator, ~12.4 s max decay),
  the CLAIM is not the stream's lifetime: the sender streams until the VALUE settles; the receiver
  decouples apply from the claim axis (v115 `c5ff11a4`, 2nd instance).
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson_stream_through_release_not_verb.md` + `desk_cursor_sync.cpp` v2.
- **An e2e assert must DISCRIMINATE the axis it claims.** `memory/lesson_e2e_assert_must_discriminate_the_axis.md`
- **The join-window PropSnapPos POSITION reconcile is eid-generic at the receiver** — a new
  save-authoritative pos reconcile is SEND-SIDE ONLY (capture baseline + flush); the chip overlay
  auto-skips a non-chip eid, so no dup. *Look FIRST:* `FlushDivergedSavePositionsForSlot` +
  `UpdateChipHostPos`. `memory/lesson_pos_reconcile_generalizes_via_generic_receiver.md`
- (Mirror STATE, not the verb — not because the verb is invisible (the GNatives substrate can now see EX_Local*), but because state-mirroring is convergent, path-agnostic, and handles the client's autonomous mutator. Verb brackets are for identity-flip / intent-attribution, where the fact you need exists only inside the verb's execution window.)**To sync a VOTV world SYSTEM (servers/alarm/…), mirror the STATE + drive the notify-free re-applier
  from the host — NEVER intercept the mutating verb** (breakServer/runTrigger are `EX_Local*` invisible).
  Poll the state field 1 Hz → broadcast on change → client raw-writes + reflected `check()`/`runTrigger`;
  client neutralizes its own autonomous mutator (disable ticker tick / zero the data array). *Look FIRST:*

- **`coop/world/email_sync` is PEER-SYMMETRIC** (each peer forwards its OWN new inbox rows) — so a client's
  FALSE self-authored email/notice is broadcast to the host + all peers = permanent SHARED-inbox pollution,
  not a cosmetic flash. Before designing a "hide a client's wrong notice" fix, check the channel's
  direction. `memory/lesson_email_sync_peer_symmetric_client_false_notice_pollutes_shared.md`
- **`server` naming/placement:** a signal-SERVER sync goes with its signal siblings in
  `coop/interactables/` (signal_sync/console_state_sync), named after the engine class (`serverBox_C` →
  `serverbox_sync`) — NOT `coop/world/` (a 14-file catch-all), and NOT "server_sync" (ambiguous with the
  NETWORK server that saturates this mod). Instance of `memory/feedback_folder_per_domain_concept_rule.md`.
- **VOTV shared-world RNG concentrates in 2 directors (`daynightCycle`/`mainGamemode`) + ~30 `ticker_*`/
  event spawners + signal/server/loot rollers — host-ownable via mirror-step-3, but our `npc_sync`
  suppress is an ALLOWLIST (15 of ~40 spawn classes) so it inherently lags** → the rule-1 root is
  STRUCTURAL (client runs NO world-spawn ticker; allowlist = MIRROR set only). Only 3 systems seed a
  `RandomStream` (garbagePileSpawner/radiotower/xmaslight) → seed-replicate; all else unseeded → suppress
  or intent. Every gap row is STATIC-INFERRED → run a LIVE client-roll probe before any fix. *Look FIRST:*

- **RNG IN a per-peer sim's RATE/output formula = a MECHANIC desync, not a display bug** — mirroring the
  output chases the divergence forever (the client re-sims with its own RNG between ticks); the host must
  own the SIM and roll the RNG, client SUPPRESSES its tick. Found only by reading the RATE block
  byte-by-byte (desk `DL_downloading @66736`: `RandomFloatInRange` needle + `RandomFloat` noise sit IN the
  rate). A "numbers differ between peers" report on anything that ACCUMULATES → read the rate, don't
  output-mirror. **COROLLARY (v111 AS-BUILT):** measure SEEDED-vs-unseeded + STORED-vs-transient first —
  the desk `noise` is unseeded AND transient (never stored; 0 RandomStream) → seed-sync structurally
  impossible → host-auth FORCED; and if the client sim writes only display-local, you OVERWRITE the
  outputs (client sim runs harmlessly), you don't suppress the tick — except an APPEND buffer (log) which
  a scalar mirror can't overwrite (kept separate). *Look FIRST:*

- **"Derived output converges for free once inputs mirror" is valid ONLY if the WHOLE input read-set
  mirrors** — enumerate every field the derivation reads; a single un-synced input silently diverges the
  output on a screen you thought was covered. Desk gate 2: frData/poData read a filter-size UPGRADE with
  NO live sync lane → would diverge on a mid-session purchase; fix = stream the OUTPUT host-auth (2 extra

- **Classify an ambient spawner's tier by its ANCHOR read** (minutes in the dump): player-camera source
  → OWNER-EFFECT; absolute float coords → world host-auth; navmesh random-walk var → world roamer; a
  PRODUCT that stalks the local player → OWNER-ENTITY. Two wrong name-and-vibes calls reversed in one

- **Peer-keyed mirror lanes have 3 measured traps** (owner_entity_sync audit): a CLIENT has no transport
  edge for another client's slot → leaver teardown must be HOST-FANNED; your own mirror spawn re-enters
  every BeginDeferred hook → ScopedMirrorSpawn-exclude EVERYWHERE incl. the rng census; collision must
  drop INSIDE the deferred window (BeginPlay overlap runs during Finish). *Look FIRST:*

- **Continuously-MOVING display state needs an unreliable pose-rate stream, not reliable snapshots** —
  the hand-item swing rendered at "1 fps" under a 0.5 s drift-gated reliable resend; split identity
  (reliable announce) from motion (MsgType::HandPose=35, RagdollPose plumbing end-to-end). AND the
  mirror interp must DEDUPE identical-target packets + ADAPT its window to the position-CHANGE cadence
  (EMA 25..80 ms, not fixed 33 ms) — a sender fps dip staircases a fixed window (v115 cursor jerks).

  suppression AND the email shadow diff (2026-07-11 `848a1fc0`: priming/diffing saveSlot.emails across
  the client's own load mis-read 2 swapped default rows as player deletes → EmailDelete broadcast →
  host rows deleted). Any poll-diff over save-backed state must gate on `world_load_episode::InEpisode()`.
  `src/coop/world/email_sync.cpp` + `coop/session/world_load_episode.h`.

- **Mirroring a multi-entry engine array needs NO lock-free scheme if all readers are GT UFunctions** —
  census the readers by disasm first; when every reader is game-thread and none caches the array across
  the write, GT run-to-completion makes a single-GT-task clear+repopulate atomic w.r.t. them (the only
  tear is splitting it across frames). No build-then-swap, no generation counter — just overwrite in one
  fn call + notify-free re-apply of derived state. Measured for container `GObjStack[Index].obj`

  `ConnState::Handshaking(1)`, holds a conn handle (IsSlotConnected TRUE) but never latches lanes, so a
  connected-edge detector fires a FALSE "Remote player left the game" (default nick, Join never processed)
  that leaks into the menu. `net_pump.cpp:791` already gated its disconnect edge on `IsSlotReady`;
  `event_feed.cpp`'s leave edge was the inconsistent one. You can only "leave" a game you were PRESENT in.

  FSM-hold at :47, and the 1 Hz claim-gated detector + the host holder-validator both raced it; the

  machine (2026-07-17: one read of `prop_destroy_seam.cpp` — the v106 K2_DestroyActor seam crosses
  keyed destroys BOTH roles — dissolved the laptop lane's whole planned BndEvt eid-capture; births
  ride the watcher/F2/eject-intent channels). The lane owns only the residue (scalars + content).
  `memory/lesson_census_generic_channels_before_new_lane_capture.md`
- **Client-birth SIDE-DATA (strings > savedScalar) correlates via the ADOPTION eid-binding** — park

- **Overlap-triggered halves of a mirrored world FSM SELF-SIMULATE on receivers** (the pose
  stream drags the prop into the trigger; Delay(0) decouples the capture from any wire-apply
  scope); verb-triggered halves NEVER self-sim — classify every transition trigger BEFORE
  designing the lane; the self-simmed half wants idempotent state lines, the verb half needs
  the wire event mandatorily (v119 driveSlot: insert self-sims, unsynced eject = permanent
  occupied-by-ghost). `memory/lesson_overlap_half_of_world_fsm_self_simulates.md`
- **Deferred wire applies (pending-until-resolvable) stash the target state AT QUEUE and DROP
  on replay if it moved** + one pending per target, newest supersedes — blind replay resurrects
  a superseded state and self-primes the baseline so no sweep ever heals it (v119 audit CRIT-1;
  the inverse of op-before-state-ready). `memory/lesson_pending_deferred_apply_stash_state_and_drop.md`
- **Deny/refund/reap handshakes correlate by ITEM CONTENT, never sender alone** — the v118
  module reap was safe only because the BYTE discriminated; single-class items (drives) need
  the payload content hash + the reap moved to the adoption-payload seam (v119 audit MAJOR-1:
  slot-only matching silently eats a legitimate same-peer birth).
  `memory/lesson_deny_refund_correlates_by_content_not_sender.md`
- **First-sight-in-sweep != birth authorship**: a joiner's save-loaded entities materialize

  clients broadcast only noted births, the host its organic world.

- **A move/sort verb on a BP array store invalidates POINTER identity AND positional diffs**
  (sortSignal = Array_Get copy + Remove + Insert -> FString deep-copy -> new ptrs every move; the v65
  RowKey + prefix-walk + ptr-keyed caches all died in one v120 pass — they were valid ONLY because the
  deck list has no move verb). Identity for such stores = content-hash MULTISET {hash->count} (move =
  no-op, duplicates = counts). **SHARPENED v121: the rule is TWO-SIDED — census the store's verb
  GRAMMAR first. NO move verb (laptop buffer quad: removeAt + tail-append only) -> an EXACT greedy

- **Lane FIFO orders HAND-OVER, not authorship** — a line deferred to a pending/retry queue is outside
  the shared-lane pin; a later cross-REFERENCING line (order/permutation/canonical-by-instance) that
  sends immediately overtakes it and the receiver skips the unknown reference (v120 order HIGH-1:
  permanent order divergence). Gate cross-referencing sends on an EMPTY pending queue (poll + rebroadcast

- **The B2 not-ready skip makes join-window lines a PERMANENT loss** (SendReliable + relay `continue`
  past !IsSlotWorldReady — nothing queues, nothing retries; a no-reconcile lane diverges at every
  mid-activity join until the NEXT join). Root idiom: per-slot snapshot at save_transfer OnRequest (the
  g_blobKeys precedent) + ready-edge seedDelta(h)=cur-snap-unmaskedPending (op-counter masks) + a client

- **A send-gate must use the send path's OWN readiness predicate** — IsSlotReady (transport) vs
  IsSlotWorldReady (the B2 gate SendReliable* itself enforces) differ exactly inside the join
  window; gating on transport-ready = every send refused + a 4 Hz no-prime/detector-refire loop for
  the whole load window (v121 smoke-caught). Zero world-ready peers = prime SILENTLY (the ready-edge

  laptop.floppyBuffer is rebuilt FROM ui_laptop.bufferSlots by updFloppy at EVERY refresh (incl. the
  refreshes OUR wire applies trigger via WriteSlot/ClearSlot); genFloppyBuffer's only caller is
  loadData; nothing native clears bufferSlots -> a raw field write without a widget rebuild is
  stomped at the next refresh. Wire apply = write fields + the native loadData recipe

- **Measure a "sibling device"'s BINDING before designing its lane — it may be a remote TERMINAL** —
  prop_portablePc binds the BASE laptop at BeginPlay (bindPC(gamemode.laptop.laptop)); its screen is
  a delegate-bound mirror (pcLaunched) that converges FREE once isOpened syncs; its whole "device
  lane" reduced to one lid bool, and the TRACKER's "own floppyTypes/floppyData" premise was a
  misattribution (the arrays are prop_floppyBox_C's). Dump the uber: BeginPlay binds? delegate

## 4. Dispatch, hooks & input seams

- **Presser-local SOUNDS/effects mirror at the NATIVE effect seam, never by classifying inputs** —
  Func-patch `AudioComponent:Play` + `ActorComponent:SetActive/Activate` and pointer-whitelist the
  target COMPONENTS (the whitelist doubles as the owner filter: the laptop's same-named comps
  self-exclude). Func-visibility is decided by the CALLEE's NATIVENESS, never the call opcode —
  EX_VirtualFunction on a native target funnels through `UFunction->Func` (286-asset census, v115).
  Echo = a GT wire-apply depth guard around EVERY wire apply; both-peers-organic callers must be
  censused FIRST; loops are STATE (join re-assert + host-owned leaver teardown), one-shots are events.
  An e2e wire self-test must OUTWAIT the receiver's world-load (+5 s fx dropped at the unresolved
  desk; +20 s from connected landed). *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_audio_effect_mirror_func_patch_native_seam.md` + `desk_snd_fx.cpp` (v115 `c5ff11a4`).

- **SET-state syncs as VALUE-ops + a host-canonical container, never slot deltas** (v118 L8,
  2026-07-18). A native uniqueness gate (the plug dup-check) makes the positional-looking array a SET:
  slot-keyed deltas lose an element permanently on a concurrent same-slot race and diverge index-read
  layouts forever; value-ops (add/remove{value}) + the host's canonical full-container broadcast +
  drain-before-adopt + a deny/refund op make divergence structurally impossible. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_set_state_syncs_as_value_ops_plus_canonical.md` + `physmods_sync.cpp` (v118).

- **The HOST's organic change never rides the remote-op apply path** (v118 L8, 2026-07-18; BOTH
  audits independently). A remote-op apply assumes NOT-YET-APPLIED state -- the host's own organic
  change is already in its authoritative state, so self-routing it hits the dup/absent branches
  (a phantom refund spawn per host plug + no canonical broadcast). Host organic diff = broadcast
  canonical directly; only CLIENT ops ride the op path. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_host_organic_change_never_rides_the_remote_op_path.md` + DrainLocalDiff (v118).

- **A GEN GUARD decouples correctness from an INFERRED dispatch-visibility fact** (v117 L6,
  2026-07-18). When an edge-suppression rule hangs on unmeasured visibility (fin()'s PE dispatch was
  doctrine-inferred, live-unmeasurable pre-hands-on), don't prove-first (blocked) or ship-on-inference
  (the crutch class): make the mechanism NON-LOAD-BEARING — the session-start edge mints max(seen)+1,
  the end edge carries the gen it terminates, receivers drop stale/duplicate ends, starts apply
  unconditionally + realign. The inferred bracket demotes to spam suppression. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_gen_guard_decouples_inferred_visibility.md` + `deck_play_sync.cpp` (v117).

- **BP INNER calls (`EX_CallMath`/`EX_*`) BYPASS ProcessEvent** — a PE hook won't fire. THIRD instance
  2026-07-10: the T1 probe's PE-table interceptors on `Delay`/`K2_SetTimer*`/`SetActorTickInterval`/`QuitGame`
  were BLIND for a whole smoke (caught by its own positive control; moved to the Func-patch seam `7109efd1`).
  BONUS: a Func-patch POST hook's `sourceObject = FFrame::Object` = the CALLING BP actor — free per-caller
  attribution, no param stepping. FOURTH instance 2026-07-10 eve (the INVERSE trap): the STATIC dump
  `$type` cannot PREDICT visibility either way — garbagePile/pinecone read `EX_CallMath` yet measurably
  FIRE the PE POST; chipPile reads the same and doesn't. Only a live catch classifies a caller.
  *Look FIRST:* the dispatch map's MECHANISM row + its live-catch evidence, never the dump alone.

- **`R::FindFunction(cls, name)` is EXACT-OWNER — no SuperStruct climb**: a parent-class UFunction
  (AActor::SetLifeSpan) looked up on a BP leaf returns NULL every call + pays a futile full-array walk
  (audit CRITICAL 2026-07-10: the ambient-mirror lifespan backstop was silently dead). SECOND STRIKE
  2026-07-11: BOTH spawn-by-key sites resolved `setKey` on the LEAF wire class → prop_crowbar_C mirrors
  spawned keyless → field key diverged from the wire binding → pickup-destroys missed the host = the
  host-side crowbar DUPE (rocks masked it: a rock IS prop_C). THIRD STRIKE 2026-07-12: the take-3
  KEY-UNIQUENESS re-key silently no-opped — trashBitsPile_C's setKey lives on actor_save_C, outside the
  hardcoded Aprop_C fallback; fixed by `R::SuperStructOf` + a chain-climbing ResolveSetKeyFn
  (`460da7e4`) — reuse that resolver shape. Resolve on the DECLARING class + cache;
  when adding any reflected-call site, grep for other leaf-class resolves of the same fn.

- **A guard/suppression that never LOGS is indistinguishable from one that never FIRES** — the client

  (PE-invisible), so the cancel NEVER reached it (*"cancel/queue lines never appeared in any real session"*,
  `kerfur_convert.cpp:97,402`) — the client has been converting LOCALLY then reconciling after the fact, and
  that dead guard is the mechanism that made take-9-bug1 possible ("kerfur deleted on both peers"). THREE
  this session, same shape (dead cancel · Model-B eid-reuse [§3 said rebindInPlace, code mints per-form eids]

  AND decline paths and find out which BEFORE building on it or deleting it. **SECOND INVERSE 2026-07-14 eve
  (log LIES the OTHER way):** `prop_lifecycle.cpp` Init POST logged `"HOST broadcasting SPAWN"`
  UNCONDITIONALLY, above the sole-express suppress gate — so a SUPPRESSED conversion still printed a broadcast
  that never happened; behavior right, log invented a failure, and it cost a detour chasing a phantom
  double-broadcast in the 20:20 take. Same root one layer down (log-SITE vs code-PATH): **a fire-line must be
  emitted from INSIDE the branch it describes — logging before a gate logs an INTENTION, not an event**, and an
  intention-log makes a working seam read as broken. Fixed `6b246201`.
  `memory/lesson_guard_that_never_logs_is_a_dead_guard.md`
- **A VM-dispatch bracket (GNatives-swap wrapper / self-bracket) runs MID-BYTECODE — do ZERO engine
  calls in that window** — capture data only (pointers, eids off a LIVE actor, class checks) + a pure DATA
  STORE (no engine dispatch); DEFER every engine call (register, park=ProcessEvent, broadcast, converge) to
  the deferred barrier. A nested ProcessEvent pump mid-verb corrupts (measured `kerfur_convert.cpp:11-20`;
  park=PE `kerfur.cpp:132`). **KERFUR MID-VERB STORE CORRECTED 2026-07-14 pm (DRAIN retired, measured-false):**
  the mid-verb store is just CAPTURING B (the successor actor pointer + index) — NO drain, NO repoint, NO
  migrate. The FINAL fix feeds that captured-B to the DEFERRED converge (`TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy` /
  `ConvergeAfterConversion`), which does its normal per-form eid mint + KerfurId re-key UNCHANGED; only WHICH-B
  is fixed (see `[[project-vm-dispatch-2a-capture-2026-07-14]]`). Core discipline (zero engine mid-verb, defer to barrier)
  is reusable for the whole VM-consumer class (kerfur/melee/smart-items). *Look FIRST:*
  `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` §3 (SUPERSEDED banner points at the A+ spec).
  `memory/lesson_vm_bracket_zero_engine_mid_verb.md`
- **The kerfur conversion verbs are SYNCHRONOUS bodies (no latent node) — so the form spawn
  (`FinishSpawningActor`) AND the `K2_DestroyActor(self)` both fire INSIDE the 0x45 bracket, every
  toggle** → capture-in-window is sound. `dropKerfurProp` 30 stmts, `spawnKerfuro` 23 stmts, both
  standalone, whole-body latent scan = NONE, none between any `BeginDeferred`/`FinishSpawning`.
  [V] two ways: import-resolved body walk + 18/18 hands-on (`722fbe18`). This is the load-bearing 2a
  premise — settled, do NOT re-dig. *Look FIRST:* `research/findings/world-systems/votv-vm-dispatch-RE-2026-07-13.md`
  (body walk + runtime). `memory/lesson_kerfur_verbs_synchronous_capture_in_window.md`
- **When a design MIGRATES identity at birth, it must cover EVERY identity map keyed on the entity** —
  GENERAL principle, holds for any repoint/rebind/re-key. TRAP that made it: "the eid" is not the whole
  identity surface — the kerfur HOST has a SECOND table (`g_actorToKerfurId`/`KerfurRecord.actor`,
  `kerfur_entity.cpp:62-64`; client is eid-based, no KerfurId map) that an eid-only rebind does NOT re-key →
  mid-window KerfurId resolves DEAD-A while eid resolves LIVE-B (heisenbug). **KERFUR RESOLUTION CORRECTED
  2026-07-14 pm (drain retired): kerfur migrates NOTHING and DRAINS NOTHING at birth** — the eid is per-form
  + K stable (`kerfur_convert.cpp:188-258`), and the FINAL fix leaves the existing converge (per-form eid mint
  + KerfurId re-key) UNCHANGED, fixing only WHICH-B (feed the captured successor to the guard). So the 2nd-map
  heisenbug cannot arise — nothing is migrated at birth to go half-done. The GENERAL enumerate-every-map
  principle still holds for ANY design that DOES migrate. *Look FIRST:* grep the entity's
  id/type + enumerate every keyed map BEFORE any migration design; `[[project-vm-dispatch-2a-capture-2026-07-14]]`
  for the A+ resolution. `memory/lesson_identity_migrate_at_birth_covers_every_map.md`
- **Before installing a PERMANENT / un-removable seam (process-lifetime GNatives swap, never un-swapped),
  measure its real cost in a THROWAWAY removable probe FIRST** — including the ENABLED=false disabled path
  (the eternal tax the process pays forever) and a WORST-CASE frame, not idle. You can't roll back a
  permanent seam; the probe you can delete. (impl /qf: the gate-2.2 probe used a simpler filter → 0.013/
  0.038 was a LOWER bound, not the real-filter gate.) *Look FIRST:* `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` §2.0
  (STEP 1.0). `memory/feedback_probe_first_for_unremovable_seams.md`
- **A destroy-seam consult runs POST-destruction: engine reads on the dying actor return ZEROS** —
  `GetActorLocation` on it reads (0,0,0) (RootComponent gone) while class/name/key MEMORY reads still
  work, so a proximity matcher silently mis-filters (take-10: the capture never fired all session).
  AND: matcher decline paths must NEVER be silent — take-10's two unlogged declines cost a full test
  cycle to localize. Positions come from caches (watch/stamps/element rows), never live dispatches on
  the dying actor. *Look FIRST:* `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` (the superseding temporal-pairing
  design). `memory/lesson_post_destroy_seam_reads_zeros_and_silent_declines.md`
- **BP-JSON call censuses: text-grepping an export for a NATIVE fn name gives FALSE NEGATIVES** — imported
  callees are bare `StackNode` indices; resolve `Imports[-idx-1].ObjectName` first (2026-07-10 twice:
  updateHold "no attach", delEmail "removes=[]"). *Look FIRST:* the resolver pattern in
  `tools/rng_census_analyze.py`. `memory/lesson_bp_json_grep_resolve_imports.md`
- **use-HOLD (`canBeUsedHold`) bypasses InputAction press-sims** — bind identity on the ENTITY-sim. `memory/lesson_use_hold_bypasses_press_seams.md`
- **An InputAction can have MULTIPLE delegate bindings — hook ALL.** `memory/lesson_input_action_multiple_delegate_bindings.md`
- **Every global `GetAsyncKeyState` hotkey poller gates on `!IsOverlayCapturingText()` too** — else it
  fires while the user types in chat (T then G triggered voice). `memory/lesson_hotkey_pollers_gate_on_overlay_text_capture.md`
- **A gated probe that "didn't fire": FIRST verify the GATE reads true.** `memory/lesson_gated_probe_verify_the_gate.md`
- **BP dynamic-multicast delegate UNBIND from C++ is an UNPROVEN capability here** (zero
  `RemoveDynamic`/`Unbind`/`ClearDelegate` in-tree) — before designing "suppress a BP event by killing its
  delegate handler", PROVE the unbind (layout RE + probe); it's a BUILD GATE. Prefer the proven
  caller-neutralization (disable a ticker / zero an array) or host-authoritative state.
  `memory/lesson_bp_delegate_unbind_unproven_capability.md`

## 5. Engine / UE4 facts

- **NEVER raw-write a UE field the game sets via a setter UFunction** — call the setter. `memory/feedback_no_raw_write_of_setter_managed_fields.md`
- **UE `TArray<struct>` stride = 16-ALIGNED size, NOT the raw `Size:`.** `memory/feedback_tarray_stride_aligned_not_raw_size.md`
- **plain `IsLive` passes a RECYCLED slot** — cached instances need `IsLiveByIndex`. A written lesson is NOT
  proof its enumeration was run: this lesson named `daynightcycle.cpp Cycle()` "good" but the sweep was never
  done → `weather_sync.cpp ResolveCycle` (setRainParticles crash, exit-to-menu 07-15) + TWO more
  (`world_actor_sync.cpp:380` OnDisconnect drain + `world_actor_mirror.cpp:208` OnDestroy — K2 on a cached
  mirror actor) all slipped it. Re-run the grep for real (`\bIsLive\s*\(` minus fresh/same-frame + autotest,
  keep cached-ptr + UFunction-CALL + teardown-reachable); all fixed 07-15.
  `memory/lesson_islive_recycled_slot_blind_use_by_index.md`
- **A runtime-spawned `AStaticMeshActor` is STATIC mobility** → set Movable BEFORE `SetActorLocation` (a
  Static root silently no-ops the teleport). `memory/lesson_runtime_staticmeshactor_must_be_movable.md`
- **SEH shields must NEVER absorb `0xC00000FD`** (stack overflow). `memory/lesson_never_absorb_stack_overflow.md`
- **nlohmann JSON: an ITERATIVE parser can still crash on its RECURSIVE `~basic_json` destructor** —
  deeply-nested untrusted JSON (within any byte cap) parses fine, then overflows the thread stack on
  scope-exit destruction; the SEH `0xC00000FD` is NOT caught by C++ `try/catch`. A hostile/MITM master
  crashed every client (fixed `7e8b1d2c`: depth-32 cap via the parse callback in
  `json_util.h::ParseObject`). *Look FIRST:* any parse of UNTRUSTED JSON must cap depth at parse — never
  rely on the byte cap / iterative parser / try-catch. `memory/lesson_nlohmann_deep_nesting_recursive_destructor_crash.md`
- **A bare proxy can NEVER be `lookAtActor`** — use a camera-ray cone. `memory/lesson_proxy_never_lookatactor_use_camera_cone.md`
- **`serverBox_C.check()` re-skins PURELY from raw `IsBroken@0x378` (never `damaged`)** — notify-free, so a
  visible break mirror = raw-write IsBroken + reflected `check()`. Offsets (CXXHeaderDump): servers@0x3F0 /
  brokenServers@0x8A0 / eff@0x400/0x404. **A base runs ~54 serverBoxes** (a farm, not a handful) — never
  assume a small fixed count; a 32-cap dropped 22 (smoke-caught). `memory/lesson_serverbox_check_reskins_from_isbroken.md`

- **VOTV `.sav` = uncompressed GVAS serialized DELTA-VS-CDO** — an absent property means "CDO default"
  (Points=10, health/maxHealth=100, Version=""); row metadata is readable OFF-THREAD via a tag-walk that
  seeks past payloads (`ue_wrap/gvas_meta`); never drive `LoadGameFromSlot` N times on the game thread
  for display data (the 2026-07-11 picker freeze). `b_` = the SANDBOX prefix, not a backup marker.
  `memory/lesson_gvas_savefile_delta_vs_cdo.md`

- **Injecting a native-parity UMG menu button = 5 gotchas** — (1) the style clone-source `tex_btnStart` is
  NULL at inject time → cloning silently falls back to Roboto/Center/white; set font/colour/justify
  DETERMINISTICALLY. (2) A spawned `UButtonSlot` (content slot) defaults to `HAlign_Center` → indented;
  set `HAlign_Fill(0)`+zero padding after SetContent (UMG.hpp:314-318; `Fill=0/Left=1/Center=2`). (3) An
  external-poll click on a real UButton must fire on the RELEASE edge (down-edge → overlay swallows the
  UP → button stuck DOWN). (4) Keep FSlateSound `ResourceObject`(0x00), zero ONLY the trailing TSharedPtr
  cache(0x08) → native `buttonclick`/`buttonrollover` play without aliasing. (5) Play VOTV sounds via
  `PlaySoundAtLocation` (null att = 2D) so the game's SoundClass/mix apply; the menu's press bg-dim is the
  submenu/loadLevel fade, NOT a per-button style (replicate with a modal ImGui backdrop).
  `memory/lesson_umg_injected_menu_button_native_parity.md`

- **UMG runtime injection = 3 traps (native version label, 2026-07-16)** — (1) raw property writes work
  ONLY pre-Slate-attach; after `AddChildTo*`, UMG has baked props into Slate, so changes MUST be setter
  UFunction dispatches (`SetColorAndOpacity` etc. — a raw write silently doesn't repaint; the "no cyan"
  bug). (2) The insert-at-top reorder (snapshot→ClearChildren→re-add) DESTROYS every slot and creates
  DEFAULTS — save each child's slot layout region before Clear + restore onto the RE-READ new slot; never
  reuse a pre-reorder slot pointer (`InsertAtTopOfVBox`, engine_widget.cpp). (3) Never assume the parent
  panel type — resolve the target's slot chain in `research/bp_reflection/<widget>_fixed.json` first
  (txt_version = a HorizontalBox row in VerticalBox_138, NOT a canvas child; the canvas-API attempt
  rendered inline-RIGHT). Look here FIRST: reuse `InjectTextRowAbove`/`SetTextBlockColorDispatch`.
  `memory/lesson_umg_runtime_inject_traps.md`

- **The literal string "None" trips WriteFNameField's failed-intern check** (StringToFName("None") ==
  {0,0} == NAME_None, indistinguishable from a failed intern; ReadStruct renders NAME_None back AS
  "None" -> string round-trips asymmetrically fail). Express NAME_None with the EMPTY string. Cost a
  3-smoke dig (v120 selftest). LOOK FIRST: signal_dynamic.cpp WriteFNameField.
  `memory/lesson_none_string_trips_fname_intern_check.md`

## 6. Assets, models, geometry

- **Curating GAME assets = census EVERY asset** — games ship broken leftovers. `memory/lesson_game_asset_census_before_curation.md`
- **`mainPlayer_C` renders TWO overlapping bodies — apply mesh to BOTH slots.** `memory/lesson_attachparent_visibility_two_body.md`
- **Cooked UE meshes store CW-outward winding — MEASURE + match** (signed volume). `memory/lesson_winding_match_template_signed_volume.md`
- **Porting SCS templates: copy behavior flags BIT-EXACTLY** (dormancy). `memory/lesson_template_faithful_scs_dormancy.md`
- **Anim nodes INSIDE a state contribute NOTHING when it exits** (post-BUA seam). `memory/lesson_animbp_state_hosted_nodes_post_bua_seam.md`
- **A learned per-bone profile is exact ONLY on its source skeleton — MEASURE fit.** `memory/lesson_converter_fit_measured_not_assumed.md`
- **NEVER strip geometry from a shipped model on geometric heuristics** (need visual proof). `memory/lesson_never_strip_shipped_geometry_without_visual_proof.md`
- **VOTV's own fonts:** `FSEX300` = Fixedsys Excelsior (font_terminal, pixel); `ShareTechMono` = font_ui
  (subtitles, Latin-only subset). `memory/reference_votv_fonts.md`

## 7. Performance

- **`GetActorLocation`/`GetComponentLocation` are UFunction DISPATCHES, not raw reads** — never bulk-call
  per-tick over thousands of actors (invisible on a fresh save, hitches the host on a mature world);
  throttle / pre-filter / read the raw transform. *Look FIRST:* `engine.cpp GetActorLocation`. `memory/lesson_getactorlocation_is_a_ufunction_dispatch.md`
- **Per-tick `GUObjectArray` walk: cheap class check BEFORE `NameOf`.** COROLLARY (v114): a
  class resolver reachable from another module's hot path (savedScalar reader at every PropSpawn
  express) carries its negative-result backoff INSIDE itself — call-site throttles don't survive
  new callers. `memory/lesson_full_array_walk_cheap_filter_before_nameof.md`
- **A periodic FPS hitch by PERIOD COINCIDENCE is not causation** — measure the real source. `memory/lesson_periodic_hitch_not_the_walk_by_period_coincidence.md`
- **A fixed-capacity hook table + ASYMMETRIC roles = a half-working fix.** `memory/lesson_hook_table_capacity_asymmetric_peers.md`
- **ImGui COMPOSITE widgets: commit via a DEBOUNCE on value-changed.** `memory/lesson_imgui_composite_commit_debounce.md`
- **The FString PIN doctrine ("mint engine-side, never free") holds ONLY for FRESH buffers** —
  repeated in-place mints on the SAME live object's fields LEAK on receivers (no native reassign ever
  runs there); swap-and-EngineFree instead (v116 perf audit finding 1). *Look FIRST:*
  `ue_wrap/devices/laptop.cpp FreeFStringSlot`. `memory/lesson_fstring_pin_doctrine_fresh_buffers_only.md`

## 8. Build / deploy / git hygiene

- **`deploy-all.ps1` deploys Release** → ALWAYS build Release + hash-verify. `memory/lesson_deploy_sources_release_config_not_relwithdebinfo.md`
- **A "pure refactor" claim becomes a MEASUREMENT via the three-commit shape: dedups first, then a
  FROZEN standalone instrument (dev TU over public APIs — the refactor commit physically can't touch
  it) + digest BASELINE x2 on the UNSPLIT code, then the move + same scenario → digests byte-equal
  cross-peer AND cross-commit** (+ literal git-diff of moved bodies, symbol-level negative grep, a
  reconnect cycle for the connect/prime/teardown surface). Digest = content-only (proven
  eid-independent). Born: the rack extraction `73dc9ba1` (2026-07-18); the recipe for the queued
  session_streams/net_pump/console_atlas extractions. *Look FIRST:*
  `votv-rack-extraction-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md` §4-5+§8; `coop/dev/drive_selftest.cpp`.
  `memory/lesson_refactor_equivalence_frozen_digest_instrument.md`
- **env/.bat host = HIDDEN lobby by design; the scoreboard listed-checkbox mirror LIES on that path**
  (2026-07-17: absence from the server browser after a .bat launch is NOT a bug — v56 rule, test
  lobbies must not pollute the list; but `AnnounceEnvHostHidden` bypasses `session_manager::SetListed`
  so `g_listedState` stays true → the checkbox shows ON while hidden; toggle off+on re-lists.
  One-line fix on record, deferred by the user). *Look FIRST:* `session_manager.cpp
  AnnounceEnvHostHidden` vs `HostWithSave`'s mirror seed.
  `memory/lesson_env_host_hidden_listed_mirror.md`
- **A NEW shared box invalidates the provision script's box-#1 assumptions — verify each service from
  OUTSIDE.** Measured on the 2026-07-16 Cloudzy migration: ufw was active default-deny (old box ran
  none) — all services green on-box, ALL dead from the internet; and dual-stack `curl ifconfig.me`
  answered v6 → the master handed unbracketed-IPv6 URIs (`curl -4` fix, `d56a4f69`). *Look FIRST:*
  survey the new box (ufw, `ss -tulnp`, its own port map) + external curl/socket check after provision.
  `memory/lesson_new_shared_box_verify_from_outside.md`
- **Endpoint move: enumerate EVERY config layer — a key ABSENT from an ini silently rides the COMPILED
  default.** 2026-07-16 VPS cutover: HOST's ini had no `[net]` block, CLIENT_3 no ini at all — a
  value-grep found only CLIENT_1/2 and would have left half the installs on the dead box. Also: a
  duplicated default literal with a "keep in sync" comment = drift bomb — alias the ONE definition
  (`cd6faf81`). *Look FIRST:* grep the OLD value repo-wide AND check each install for key-ABSENCE;
  flip `protocol.h` constants in the same change. `memory/lesson_endpoint_move_enumerate_config_layers.md`
- **Pre-push leak audit (PUBLIC repo) catches ASSOCIATION leaks, not just secrets; a commit REBUILD
  danglees every doc'd SHA.** 2026-07-16 s13b: the migration commits leaked zero credentials but tied
  both VPS IPs to the other tenants' service names — for a proxy stack that IS the payload; scrubbed +
  commits rebuilt (`d56a4f69`/`cd6faf81`/`c653a538`), which dangled 9 already-written SHA refs across
  docs+memory. *Look FIRST:* `gh repo view --json isPrivate`; grep the diff for service names/hostnames
  near IPs (a leftover hit is OK only as a REMOVAL line: `grep -vE '^[0-9]+:-'` on the hits = empty);
  after any rewrite grep the OLD SHAs across docs/ research/ memory/.
  `memory/feedback_push_leak_audit_service_ties_and_sha_rewrite.md`
- **Git-Bash (MSYS2) MANGLES remote `/abs/paths` → `C:/Program Files/Git/...`** — any argv that looks
  like a POSIX absolute path is Windows-ified BEFORE the child sees it, so `vps.py put <local>
  /opt/x/y` uploads to a REMOTE path literally named `C:/Program Files/Git/opt/x/y` (silent, no error).
  Prefix `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for ANY remote-host op (ssh/scp/`vps.py run|put`/docker exec) that
  references a Linux path. Symptom: a "successful" op whose target is `C:/Program Files/Git/...`, or a
  Linux box growing a top-level `C:` dir. PowerShell is unaffected. `memory/lesson_msys_no_pathconv_mangles_remote_paths.md`
- **ANY wire-format change bumps `kProtocolVersion`** (new/removed `MsgType`/`ReliableKind`, changed
  payload, changed reliability/cadence) — else two builds differing on the wire connect at the same
  version + silently degrade; the gate (`session.cpp:352-371`) HARD-CLOSEs on a mismatch instead. Caught
  by the `/documentize` sweep 2026-07-15 (clock F added `ClockPose=37` + dropped the reliable periodic on
  v109; bumped to 110). *Look FIRST:* any diff touching `protocol.h` enums/payloads or a `Send*` flag.
  `memory/feedback_wire_format_change_bumps_protocol_version.md`
- **The smoke HOST slot `s_1234` is STATEFUL — restore `coop_backup` FIRST.** `memory/lesson_s1234_host_slot_stateful_coop_backup.md`
- **`votv-coop.log` is TRUNCATED at boot (no rotation)** — copy a peer's log to the scratchpad BEFORE any
  mid-run relaunch or the previous life's evidence is destroyed (2026-07-10: an 18-min census slice lost).
  **Idle death claims BOTH peers — ROOT = STARVATION, now keepalive-fixed** (2026-07-10 night: harness
  save starts food=24.4, idle drain ~2.3 food/min, measured by the ticker's own pre-refill log;
  `[dev] vitals_keepalive_sec=180` `0211b9c5` pins vitals -> 65-min continuous run, zero deaths)
  (client ~18 min, HOST ~80 min — the 14:27:16 "LOCAL PLAYER DIED
  role=HOST" real log): a later "connect timed out" against such a host is CORRECT, not a join bug (the
  2026-07-10 "stale-slot race" candidate was exactly this, refuted from the saved logs). Long exposure
  runs must keep peers alive or script around per-peer deaths.
  `memory/lesson_copy_peer_log_before_relaunch.md`

- **OWNER-EFFECT RULE (user, 2026-07-10)** — player-proximity ambient effects (color wisps, fireflies,
  autumn leaves): the local peer KEEPS rolling them (never host-rolled, never suppressed) but a
  cross-peer mirror makes them visible to all peers. Shipped precedent = `coop/world/firefly_sync`
  (v51) — generalize THAT shape, don't invent. Look FIRST: docs/COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md USER DECISIONS +
  `memory/feedback_owner_effect_rule.md`

- **A one-shot session-start pass over world state parks/indexes NOTHING — the world materializes
  LATER** (2026-07-10, spawn_authority: initial park pass found 0 instances; the fix is
  hunt-until-first-hit at 1 Hz then relax). Instance #4 of the snapshot-before-state-ready class.
  Look FIRST: `memory/feedback_snapshot_before_state_ready.md`

- **Making a static/absent MIRROR MOVE can WAKE dormant per-peer OUTPUT generation** (2026-07-15, desk
  cursor v109). The jaggy-cursor fix animated the host's coords-panel cursor mirror; the host's native BP
  then began appending LOCAL `MOVE_*` coordLog lines from that motion (silent while the mirror was frozen),
  and `ProduceLogLines` running on "EVERY peer" shipped them → host shipped 78 log lines vs client 13 = a
  NEW divergence the fix created. You test the axis you fixed (cursor = smooth) and miss the downstream axis
  the motion now DRIVES (the log). Rule: after animating any mirror, enumerate every per-peer producer that
  reads the now-moving field (log producers, tick-sims, ship counters) and gate it to the owner / suppress
  the non-owner path. A "mirror the input" change is incomplete until "don't ALSO generate the output
  locally" is done. **2nd instance (v115b `de31889e`): the wake needs NO animation — ONE wire-applied
  BOOL (coord_isPing) started a phantom ping FSM on every observer (latent tick machine, analogd uber
  @82980 → @80105). Before mirroring ANY BP field, classify it: display scalar vs a latent machine's
  RUN-FLAG — run-flags NEVER raw-mirror.** Family of OWNER-EFFECT + mirror-STATE-not-verb. Look FIRST:

- **NEVER `git add -A`/`<dir>` over held WIP — explicit paths or stash.** `memory/lesson_never_git_add_A_over_held_wip.md`
- **Held-WIP files inside a tree-wide refactor: commit the MECHANICAL hunks index-side**
  (`git show HEAD:f | rewrite | git hash-object -w | git update-index --cacheinfo` -> status `MM`;

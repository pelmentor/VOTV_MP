# LESSONS — what VOTV_MP has learned the hard way

The single browsable ledger of durable lessons + **DIG-RULE** lessons. Each row is a takeaway, a
"look here FIRST next time" pointer where one applies, and a link to the full `memory/` file (the
authoritative detail). This complements — does not replace — `MEMORY.md` (the terse auto-memory index
loaded each session): `MEMORY.md` is the machine index; this is the human-readable, categorized digest.

**Maintained by `/documentize`** (Step 3.5): every sweep ADDS the session's new lessons and RECONCILES
existing rows for staleness (a row whose cited symbol/path moved is fixed or archived — a lesson pointing
at a dead symbol sends the next session on a worse dig than no lesson at all). A lesson earns a row only
if it saves a FUTURE dig.

> Links use the `memory/` slug: `memory/<slug>.md`.

## 0. The DIG-RULE (why this file exists)

**When a dig produces a hard-won measured fact, record it as a durable lesson so a future session reads it
instead of re-excavating the same hole.** Born because the project dug the same place twice (rock F2,
2026-07-08/09) and the user made it a rule. Two faces:

- **MAP-ALL-WIRE-EVENTS** — when a synced entity does not APPEAR / STICK / flickers / resets on a peer,
  MAP the full set of wire events ONE action emits (both peers, tick order) BEFORE building any fix; a
  later same-key event can silently UNDO an earlier one. `memory/feedback_map_all_wire_events_before_fixing_missing_sync.md`
- **PROBE-DON'T-GUESS** — MEASURE the root with a read-only probe before building a fix; a design stays
  provisional until the probe discriminates it. `memory/feedback_probe_dont_guess_rule.md`
- **VERIFY, don't re-derive** — recalled memory reflects what was true WHEN WRITTEN; verify a cited
  file/function/offset/flag still exists before recommending it (this is why staleness reconciliation is
  part of every sweep).

---

## 1. How to work (process / working agreements)

- **"per rule 1" = full green light** for the root-cause fix in its complete form (incl. hard
  architectural change). Don't scope down, don't ask "is this too big". `memory/feedback_no_crutch_questions_act_autonomously.md`
- **No design/architect AGENTS** — design yourself from code + docs + MTA; search + audit agents OK. `memory/feedback_no_design_architect_agents.md`
- **Claude OWNS every mechanical chore** (ini flags, grep/log-read, build, deploy) — never hand them to the
  user; the user does only in-game actions. `memory/feedback_claude_owns_all_mechanical_chores.md`
- **User ON the PC = USER tests**; Claude launches only user-AWAY + green-lit. `memory/feedback_user_tests_claude_prepares_ground.md`
- **Ask in PLAIN TEXT, never the AskUserQuestion UI.** `memory/feedback_ask_in_text_not_question_ui.md`
- **Never assert a VOTV game-domain fact from assumption** — verify vs SDK/bp_reflect/wiki FIRST. `memory/feedback_verify_game_domain_facts.md`
- **RE all related blueprints STATICALLY before any runtime probe.** `memory/feedback_re_blueprints_before_probes.md`
- **Commit autonomously at verified checkpoints; still ASK before PUSH.** `memory/feedback_commit_autonomously.md`
- **Never retire a load-bearing fix on an unverified theory.** `memory/feedback_verify_before_retiring_a_fix.md`
- **SAME bug after 2+ targeted fixes = the patch LEVEL is wrong; the root is architectural** — stop patching, re-root. `memory/feedback_recurring_bug_is_architectural.md`
- **A cross-cutting axis has ONE owner** — handlers CAPTURE, never apply (anti-smear). `memory/feedback_one_owner_order_axis.md`
- **Fix a mirror-identity race WORKING first, generalize only after N>=3.** `memory/feedback_fix_then_generalize_mirror_identity.md`
- **Every source FOLDER = ONE domain concept; no catch-all names.** `memory/feedback_folder_per_domain_concept_rule.md`
- **RULE 2 does NOT apply to probes/diagnostics/tools** (they may stay). `memory/feedback_rule2_exempts_probes_diagnostics_tools.md`
- **Test/probe flags live in `votv-coop.ini [dev]`, NOT bats/env.** `memory/feedback_test_flags_in_ini_not_bats_or_env.md`
- **`docs/piles/` is the LIVING pile KB** — mark DESIGN vs AS-BUILT vs VERIFIED. `memory/feedback_docs_piles_living_knowledge_base.md`

## 2. Join-window identity & the DUP-prone zone (measure before touching)

- **A client grab/drop of a host-owned keyed prop = a MOVE with TWO same-key halves** (SPAWN author + a
  co-fired grab-hook DESTROY); the DESTROY is usually the killer. *Look FIRST:* the destroy-seam, not the
  spawn author. `memory/lesson_client_keyed_prop_move_two_wire_halves.md`
- **A host OnSpawn log line != VISIBLE** — check the immediate same-tick OnDestroy (destroy-by-key kills
  the newest). `memory/lesson_onspawn_log_not_proof_check_immediate_destroy.md`
- **REUSE the proven author (with its gates), don't raw-reimplement** — a raw MarkPropElement broke the
  E-grab decline. `memory/lesson_reuse_proven_author_not_raw_reimpl.md`
- **A join reconcile that DESTROYS local actors needs a quiescence gate + caps.** `memory/feedback_join_reconcile_sweep_safety.md`
- **An op applied BEFORE the state it reads is ready recurs** — gate/defer (snapshot-before-state-ready). `memory/feedback_snapshot_before_state_ready.md`
- **chipPiles persist in `primitivesData`; off-kerfurs in `objectsData`** (different save lanes). `memory/lesson_chippile_saved_in_primitivesData_not_objectsData.md`
- **DELIVERY-axis: join DELIVERY vs IDENTITY are separate; ONE owner = `prop_snapshot`.** `memory/feedback_deliver_missing_owner_delivery_axis.md`
- **EVERY in-episode wire expression is PROVISIONAL** — loadObjects churn recreates only save-WORLD
  records (a hotbar'd-at-capture prop has none -> dead mirror row forever). ORDER: the revalidation
  drain runs at the quiescence fire edge BEFORE the doom sweep — doom judges LAST (the tail placement
  doomed-then-resurrected 230 props = the take-3 2.5 fps storm). *Look FIRST:* client-log dead-row
  TRIPWIRE + [SPAWN-DEFER] arm/apply + per-doom key/loc lines; on an fps/placement anomaly diff the
  doomed-vs-re-expressed KEY SETS. `memory/lesson_join_window_wire_expression_provisional.md`
- **VOTV's OWN save ships DUPLICATE interactable Keys** (85 trashBitsPile_C across 4 keys — save-born
  clone families; the 06-24 sweep silently doomed "80 trashBitsPile" for weeks). Key uniqueness is OUR
  invariant: the HOST re-keys duplicates at enroll (MarkPropElement, the one owner; GT-gated setKey;
  dead incumbent = churn recreate inheriting identity). *Look FIRST:* host-log "KEY-UNIQUENESS ...
  re-keyed" burst; same-key multiplicity histogram in the adopt burst.
  `memory/lesson_votv_save_ships_duplicate_interactable_keys.md`
- **MirrorManager\<Prop\> MIXES census LOCAL rows with wire rows (one actor can carry BOTH)** — an
  actor->eid reverse meaning "established cross-peer identity" must filter `IsMirror()`
  (`ResolveMirrorEidByActor(wireMirrorOnly)`), else it kills the Gap-I-1 divergent-key dedup.
  *Look FIRST:* mirror_manager.h "MIXES" block. `memory/lesson_prop_mirror_manager_mixes_local_and_wire_rows.md`
- **Identity-critical log lines carry cls+key+loc (USER RULE)** — a class histogram alone makes
  per-entity RCA impossible; cold paths only, never at the POST-native destroy seam (PendingKill),
  throttle mass arms. `memory/feedback_identity_logs_carry_key_and_loc.md`

## 3. Sync architecture (owners, routers, lifecycle)

- **Follow MTA architecture when possible** (vendored `reference/mtasa-blue/`). `memory/feedback_follow_mta_architecture.md`
- **A new `ReliableKind` wires in THREE places** — check the router checklist. `memory/feedback_reliablekind_router_checklist.md`
- **Host TRACKING/enroll gates on HOSTING, never `connected()`.** `memory/lesson_tracking_gates_on_hosting_not_connected.md`
- **EVERY session-end path runs the FULL teardown fanout.** `memory/lesson_every_session_end_path_full_teardown_fanout.md`
- **Every client-side SUPPRESSION is a LOAN, not a purchase (N=3: weather 06-11, serverbox 07-09,
  garbage_sync 07-10).** Persistent-state neutralizations (tick-disable, field-zero, TimeScale=0,
  suppress flags) need an EXPLICIT OnDisconnect restore; fn-body PRE-cancels SELF-restore ONLY when
  gated on `s->running()`/`connected()` — a bare `role()==Client` gate keeps suppressing in SOLO play
  forever (Stop never resets cfg_.role). *Look FIRST:* name the restore mechanism in the SAME commit;
  census: grep bare role-gates without running(). `memory/lesson_suppression_needs_paired_restore_or_running_gate.md`
- **Pre-world subsystems Install at StartCoopSession, NOT world-gated.** `memory/feedback_preworld_install_at_startcoopsession.md`
- **When a release VERB can't be caught, STREAM THROUGH the state.** `memory/lesson_stream_through_release_not_verb.md`
- **An e2e assert must DISCRIMINATE the axis it claims.** `memory/lesson_e2e_assert_must_discriminate_the_axis.md`
- **The join-window PropSnapPos POSITION reconcile is eid-generic at the receiver** — a new
  save-authoritative pos reconcile is SEND-SIDE ONLY (capture baseline + flush); the chip overlay
  auto-skips a non-chip eid, so no dup. *Look FIRST:* `FlushDivergedSavePositionsForSlot` +
  `UpdateChipHostPos`. `memory/lesson_pos_reconcile_generalizes_via_generic_receiver.md`
- **To sync a VOTV world SYSTEM (servers/alarm/…), mirror the STATE + drive the notify-free re-applier
  from the host — NEVER intercept the mutating verb** (breakServer/runTrigger are `EX_Local*` invisible).
  Poll the state field 1 Hz → broadcast on change → client raw-writes + reflected `check()`/`runTrigger`;
  client neutralizes its own autonomous mutator (disable ticker tick / zero the data array). *Look FIRST:*
  `coop/world/alarm_sync.cpp` (one instance) + `coop/interactables/serverbox_sync.cpp` (an array).
  `memory/lesson_votv_world_system_sync_mirror_state_not_verb.md`
- **`coop/world/email_sync` is PEER-SYMMETRIC** (each peer forwards its OWN new inbox rows) — so a client's
  FALSE self-authored email/notice is broadcast to the host + all peers = permanent SHARED-inbox pollution,
  not a cosmetic flash. Before designing a "hide a client's wrong notice" fix, check the channel's
  direction. `memory/lesson_email_sync_peer_symmetric_client_false_notice_pollutes_shared.md`
- **`server` naming/placement:** a signal-SERVER sync goes with its signal siblings in
  `coop/interactables/` (signal_sync/console_state_sync), named after the engine class (`serverBox_C` →
  `serverbox_sync`) — NOT `coop/world/` (a 14-file catch-all), and NOT "server_sync" (ambiguous with the
  NETWORK server that saturates this mod). Instance of `memory/feedback_folder_per_domain_concept_rule.md`.
- **VOTV shared-world RNG concentrates in 2 directors (`daynightCycle`/`mainGamemode`) + ~30 `ticker_*`/
  event spawners + signal/server/loot rollers — host-ownable via mirror-step-3, but our `npc_sync`
  suppress is an ALLOWLIST (15 of ~40 spawn classes) so it inherently lags** → the rule-1 root is
  STRUCTURAL (client runs NO world-spawn ticker; allowlist = MIRROR set only). Only 3 systems seed a
  `RandomStream` (garbagePileSpawner/radiotower/xmaslight) → seed-replicate; all else unseeded → suppress
  or intent. Every gap row is STATIC-INFERRED → run a LIVE client-roll probe before any fix. *Look FIRST:*
  `docs/COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md` (living tracker) + `memory/lesson_votv_rng_host_ownable_at_ticker_director_layer.md`.

- **Classify an ambient spawner's tier by its ANCHOR read** (minutes in the dump): player-camera source
  → OWNER-EFFECT; absolute float coords → world host-auth; navmesh random-walk var → world roamer; a
  PRODUCT that stalks the local player → OWNER-ENTITY. Two wrong name-and-vibes calls reversed in one
  day (pinecone wrongly suppressed; sky wisps wrongly per-peer). *Look FIRST:*
  `research/findings/world-systems/votv-ambient-anchor-audit-RE-2026-07-10.md` + the tier table in spawn_authority.h.
  `memory/lesson_ambient_spawner_anchor_read_decides_tier.md`
- **Peer-keyed mirror lanes have 3 measured traps** (owner_entity_sync audit): a CLIENT has no transport
  edge for another client's slot → leaver teardown must be HOST-FANNED; your own mirror spawn re-enters
  every BeginDeferred hook → ScopedMirrorSpawn-exclude EVERYWHERE incl. the rng census; collision must
  drop INSIDE the deferred window (BeginPlay overlap runs during Finish). *Look FIRST:*
  `coop/creatures/owner_entity_sync.cpp` (reference impl). `memory/lesson_peer_keyed_mirror_lane_traps.md`

- **Continuously-MOVING display state needs an unreliable pose-rate stream, not reliable snapshots** —
  the hand-item swing rendered at "1 fps" under a 0.5 s drift-gated reliable resend; split identity
  (reliable announce) from motion (MsgType::HandPose=35, RagdollPose plumbing end-to-end).
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson_continuous_motion_needs_pose_stream.md` (v109 `a3c55529`).
- **The client join world-load episode now guards TWO consumers** — the v106 keyed-destroy broadcast
  suppression AND the email shadow diff (2026-07-11 `848a1fc0`: priming/diffing saveSlot.emails across
  the client's own load mis-read 2 swapped default rows as player deletes → EmailDelete broadcast →
  host rows deleted). Any poll-diff over save-backed state must gate on `world_load_episode::InEpisode()`.
  `src/coop/world/email_sync.cpp` + `coop/props/world_load_episode.h`.

## 4. Dispatch, hooks & input seams

- **BP INNER calls (`EX_CallMath`/`EX_*`) BYPASS ProcessEvent** — a PE hook won't fire. THIRD instance
  2026-07-10: the T1 probe's PE-table interceptors on `Delay`/`K2_SetTimer*`/`SetActorTickInterval`/`QuitGame`
  were BLIND for a whole smoke (caught by its own positive control; moved to the Func-patch seam `7109efd1`).
  BONUS: a Func-patch POST hook's `sourceObject = FFrame::Object` = the CALLING BP actor — free per-caller
  attribution, no param stepping. FOURTH instance 2026-07-10 eve (the INVERSE trap): the STATIC dump
  `$type` cannot PREDICT visibility either way — garbagePile/pinecone read `EX_CallMath` yet measurably
  FIRE the PE POST; chipPile reads the same and doesn't. Only a live catch classifies a caller.
  *Look FIRST:* the dispatch map's MECHANISM row + its live-catch evidence, never the dump alone.
  `memory/lesson_ex_callmath_invisible_to_processevent.md`
- **`R::FindFunction(cls, name)` is EXACT-OWNER — no SuperStruct climb**: a parent-class UFunction
  (AActor::SetLifeSpan) looked up on a BP leaf returns NULL every call + pays a futile full-array walk
  (audit CRITICAL 2026-07-10: the ambient-mirror lifespan backstop was silently dead). SECOND STRIKE
  2026-07-11: BOTH spawn-by-key sites resolved `setKey` on the LEAF wire class → prop_crowbar_C mirrors
  spawned keyless → field key diverged from the wire binding → pickup-destroys missed the host = the
  host-side crowbar DUPE (rocks masked it: a rock IS prop_C). Resolve on the DECLARING class + cache;
  when adding any reflected-call site, grep for other leaf-class resolves of the same fn.
  *Look FIRST:* the SDK header for which class declares the fn + the RCA finding
  `research/findings/props-lifecycle/votv-crowbar-mirror-key-divergence-RCA-2026-07-11.md`.
  `memory/lesson_findfunction_exact_owner_no_superstruct_climb.md`
- **VOTV damage NEVER touches UE TakeDamage/ApplyDamage** — melee = `mainPlayer.attack` →
  per-class `addDamage`/`damageByPlayer`, ALL EX_Local-invisible inward from `attack`; the ONE
  Func-patchable choke is `VictoryFloatMinusEquals` (every prop+creature health write; FFrame::Object =
  target). A client's hits are LOCAL-ONLY today (user live 2026-07-11: zero damage cross-peer, silent
  crowbar door hits). The mannequin is a PROP (`Aprop_mannequin_C : Aprop_C`), not a Character.
  *Look FIRST:* `research/findings/player-puppet/votv-melee-damage-path-RE-2026-07-11.md` (chain + ranked hook seams).
  `memory/lesson_votv_damage_bypasses_ue_takedamage.md`
- **A SCRIPT-fn called via `EX_Local*` is invisible to BOTH the PE hook AND the Func-patch** — patch the
  NATIVE calls inside it. `memory/lesson_script_fn_invisible_to_func_patch.md`
- **BP-JSON call censuses: text-grepping an export for a NATIVE fn name gives FALSE NEGATIVES** — imported
  callees are bare `StackNode` indices; resolve `Imports[-idx-1].ObjectName` first (2026-07-10 twice:
  updateHold "no attach", delEmail "removes=[]"). *Look FIRST:* the resolver pattern in
  `tools/rng_census_analyze.py`. `memory/lesson_bp_json_grep_resolve_imports.md`
- **use-HOLD (`canBeUsedHold`) bypasses InputAction press-sims** — bind identity on the ENTITY-sim. `memory/lesson_use_hold_bypasses_press_seams.md`
- **An InputAction can have MULTIPLE delegate bindings — hook ALL.** `memory/lesson_input_action_multiple_delegate_bindings.md`
- **Every global `GetAsyncKeyState` hotkey poller gates on `!IsOverlayCapturingText()` too** — else it
  fires while the user types in chat (T then G triggered voice). `memory/lesson_hotkey_pollers_gate_on_overlay_text_capture.md`
- **A gated probe that "didn't fire": FIRST verify the GATE reads true.** `memory/lesson_gated_probe_verify_the_gate.md`
- **BP dynamic-multicast delegate UNBIND from C++ is an UNPROVEN capability here** (zero
  `RemoveDynamic`/`Unbind`/`ClearDelegate` in-tree) — before designing "suppress a BP event by killing its
  delegate handler", PROVE the unbind (layout RE + probe); it's a BUILD GATE. Prefer the proven
  caller-neutralization (disable a ticker / zero an array) or host-authoritative state.
  `memory/lesson_bp_delegate_unbind_unproven_capability.md`

## 5. Engine / UE4 facts

- **NEVER raw-write a UE field the game sets via a setter UFunction** — call the setter. `memory/feedback_no_raw_write_of_setter_managed_fields.md`
- **UE `TArray<struct>` stride = 16-ALIGNED size, NOT the raw `Size:`.** `memory/feedback_tarray_stride_aligned_not_raw_size.md`
- **plain `IsLive` passes a RECYCLED slot** — cached instances need `IsLiveByIndex`. `memory/lesson_islive_recycled_slot_blind_use_by_index.md`
- **A runtime-spawned `AStaticMeshActor` is STATIC mobility** → set Movable BEFORE `SetActorLocation` (a
  Static root silently no-ops the teleport). `memory/lesson_runtime_staticmeshactor_must_be_movable.md`
- **SEH shields must NEVER absorb `0xC00000FD`** (stack overflow). `memory/lesson_never_absorb_stack_overflow.md`
- **A bare proxy can NEVER be `lookAtActor`** — use a camera-ray cone. `memory/lesson_proxy_never_lookatactor_use_camera_cone.md`
- **`serverBox_C.check()` re-skins PURELY from raw `IsBroken@0x378` (never `damaged`)** — notify-free, so a
  visible break mirror = raw-write IsBroken + reflected `check()`. Offsets (CXXHeaderDump): servers@0x3F0 /
  brokenServers@0x8A0 / eff@0x400/0x404. **A base runs ~54 serverBoxes** (a farm, not a handful) — never
  assume a small fixed count; a 32-cap dropped 22 (smoke-caught). `memory/lesson_serverbox_check_reskins_from_isbroken.md`

- **VOTV `.sav` = uncompressed GVAS serialized DELTA-VS-CDO** — an absent property means "CDO default"
  (Points=10, health/maxHealth=100, Version=""); row metadata is readable OFF-THREAD via a tag-walk that
  seeks past payloads (`ue_wrap/gvas_meta`); never drive `LoadGameFromSlot` N times on the game thread
  for display data (the 2026-07-11 picker freeze). `b_` = the SANDBOX prefix, not a backup marker.
  `memory/lesson_gvas_savefile_delta_vs_cdo.md`

## 6. Assets, models, geometry

- **Curating GAME assets = census EVERY asset** — games ship broken leftovers. `memory/lesson_game_asset_census_before_curation.md`
- **`mainPlayer_C` renders TWO overlapping bodies — apply mesh to BOTH slots.** `memory/lesson_attachparent_visibility_two_body.md`
- **Cooked UE meshes store CW-outward winding — MEASURE + match** (signed volume). `memory/lesson_winding_match_template_signed_volume.md`
- **Porting SCS templates: copy behavior flags BIT-EXACTLY** (dormancy). `memory/lesson_template_faithful_scs_dormancy.md`
- **Anim nodes INSIDE a state contribute NOTHING when it exits** (post-BUA seam). `memory/lesson_animbp_state_hosted_nodes_post_bua_seam.md`
- **A learned per-bone profile is exact ONLY on its source skeleton — MEASURE fit.** `memory/lesson_converter_fit_measured_not_assumed.md`
- **NEVER strip geometry from a shipped model on geometric heuristics** (need visual proof). `memory/lesson_never_strip_shipped_geometry_without_visual_proof.md`
- **VOTV's own fonts:** `FSEX300` = Fixedsys Excelsior (font_terminal, pixel); `ShareTechMono` = font_ui
  (subtitles, Latin-only subset). `memory/reference_votv_fonts.md`

## 7. Performance

- **`GetActorLocation`/`GetComponentLocation` are UFunction DISPATCHES, not raw reads** — never bulk-call
  per-tick over thousands of actors (invisible on a fresh save, hitches the host on a mature world);
  throttle / pre-filter / read the raw transform. *Look FIRST:* `engine.cpp GetActorLocation`. `memory/lesson_getactorlocation_is_a_ufunction_dispatch.md`
- **Per-tick `GUObjectArray` walk: cheap class check BEFORE `NameOf`.** `memory/lesson_full_array_walk_cheap_filter_before_nameof.md`
- **A periodic FPS hitch by PERIOD COINCIDENCE is not causation** — measure the real source. `memory/lesson_periodic_hitch_not_the_walk_by_period_coincidence.md`
- **A fixed-capacity hook table + ASYMMETRIC roles = a half-working fix.** `memory/lesson_hook_table_capacity_asymmetric_peers.md`
- **ImGui COMPOSITE widgets: commit via a DEBOUNCE on value-changed.** `memory/lesson_imgui_composite_commit_debounce.md`

## 8. Build / deploy / git hygiene

- **`deploy-all.ps1` deploys Release** → ALWAYS build Release + hash-verify. `memory/lesson_deploy_sources_release_config_not_relwithdebinfo.md`
- **The smoke HOST slot `s_1234` is STATEFUL — restore `coop_backup` FIRST.** `memory/lesson_s1234_host_slot_stateful_coop_backup.md`
- **`votv-coop.log` is TRUNCATED at boot (no rotation)** — copy a peer's log to the scratchpad BEFORE any
  mid-run relaunch or the previous life's evidence is destroyed (2026-07-10: an 18-min census slice lost).
  **Idle death claims BOTH peers — ROOT = STARVATION, now keepalive-fixed** (2026-07-10 night: harness
  save starts food=24.4, idle drain ~2.3 food/min, measured by the ticker's own pre-refill log;
  `[dev] vitals_keepalive_sec=180` `0211b9c5` pins vitals -> 65-min continuous run, zero deaths)
  (client ~18 min, HOST ~80 min — the 14:27:16 "LOCAL PLAYER DIED
  role=HOST" real log): a later "connect timed out" against such a host is CORRECT, not a join bug (the
  2026-07-10 "stale-slot race" candidate was exactly this, refuted from the saved logs). Long exposure
  runs must keep peers alive or script around per-peer deaths.
  `memory/lesson_copy_peer_log_before_relaunch.md`

- **OWNER-EFFECT RULE (user, 2026-07-10)** — player-proximity ambient effects (color wisps, fireflies,
  autumn leaves): the local peer KEEPS rolling them (never host-rolled, never suppressed) but a
  cross-peer mirror makes them visible to all peers. Shipped precedent = `coop/world/firefly_sync`
  (v51) — generalize THAT shape, don't invent. Look FIRST: docs/COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md USER DECISIONS +
  `memory/feedback_owner_effect_rule.md`

- **A one-shot session-start pass over world state parks/indexes NOTHING — the world materializes
  LATER** (2026-07-10, spawn_authority: initial park pass found 0 instances; the fix is
  hunt-until-first-hit at 1 Hz then relax). Instance #4 of the snapshot-before-state-ready class.
  Look FIRST: `memory/feedback_snapshot_before_state_ready.md`
- **NEVER `git add -A`/`<dir>` over held WIP — explicit paths or stash.** `memory/lesson_never_git_add_A_over_held_wip.md`
- **AUTONOMOUS pile test loop harness** (reference). `memory/reference_pile_test_harness.md`

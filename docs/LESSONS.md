# LESSONS — what VOTV_MP has learned the hard way

The single browsable ledger of durable lessons + **DIG-RULE** lessons. Each row is a takeaway, a
"look here FIRST next time" pointer where one applies, and a link to the full `memory/` file (the
authoritative detail). This complements — does not replace — `MEMORY.md` (the terse auto-memory index
loaded each session): `MEMORY.md` is the machine index; this is the human-readable, categorized digest.

**Maintained by `/documentize`** (Step 3.5): every sweep ADDS the session's new lessons and RECONCILES
existing rows for staleness (a row whose cited symbol/path moved is fixed or archived — a lesson pointing
at a dead symbol sends the next session on a worse dig than no lesson at all). A lesson earns a row only
if it saves a FUTURE dig.

> Links use the `memory/` slug: `memory/<slug>.md`.

## 0. The DIG-RULE (why this file exists)

**When a dig produces a hard-won measured fact, record it as a durable lesson so a future session reads it
instead of re-excavating the same hole.** Born because the project dug the same place twice (rock F2,
2026-07-08/09) and the user made it a rule. Two faces:

- **MAP-ALL-WIRE-EVENTS** — when a synced entity does not APPEAR / STICK / flickers / resets on a peer,
  MAP the full set of wire events ONE action emits (both peers, tick order) BEFORE building any fix; a
  later same-key event can silently UNDO an earlier one. `memory/feedback_map_all_wire_events_before_fixing_missing_sync.md`
- **PROBE-DON'T-GUESS** — MEASURE the root with a read-only probe before building a fix; a design stays
  provisional until the probe discriminates it. `memory/feedback_probe_dont_guess_rule.md`
- **VERIFY, don't re-derive** — recalled memory reflects what was true WHEN WRITTEN; verify a cited
  file/function/offset/flag still exists before recommending it (this is why staleness reconciliation is
  part of every sweep).

## 1. How to work (process / working agreements)

- **"per rule 1" = full green light** for the root-cause fix in its complete form (incl. hard
  architectural change). Don't scope down, don't ask "is this too big". `memory/feedback_no_crutch_questions_act_autonomously.md`
- **No design/architect AGENTS** — design yourself from code + docs + MTA; search + audit agents OK. `memory/feedback_no_design_architect_agents.md`
- **Claude OWNS every mechanical chore** (ini flags, grep/log-read, build, deploy) — never hand them to the
  user; the user does only in-game actions. `memory/feedback_claude_owns_all_mechanical_chores.md`
- **User ON the PC = USER tests**; Claude launches only user-AWAY + green-lit. `memory/feedback_user_tests_claude_prepares_ground.md`
- **Ask in PLAIN TEXT, never the AskUserQuestion UI.** `memory/feedback_ask_in_text_not_question_ui.md`
- **Never assert a VOTV game-domain fact from assumption** — verify vs SDK/bp_reflect/wiki FIRST. `memory/feedback_verify_game_domain_facts.md`
- **RE all related blueprints STATICALLY before any runtime probe.** `memory/feedback_re_blueprints_before_probes.md`
- **Commit autonomously at verified checkpoints; still ASK before PUSH.** `memory/feedback_commit_autonomously.md`
- **Never retire a load-bearing fix on an unverified theory.** `memory/feedback_verify_before_retiring_a_fix.md`
- **SAME bug after 2+ targeted fixes = the patch LEVEL is wrong; the root is architectural** — stop patching, re-root. `memory/feedback_recurring_bug_is_architectural.md`
- **A cross-cutting axis has ONE owner** — handlers CAPTURE, never apply (anti-smear). `memory/feedback_one_owner_order_axis.md`
- **Fix a mirror-identity race WORKING first, generalize only after N>=3.** `memory/feedback_fix_then_generalize_mirror_identity.md`
- **Every source FOLDER = ONE domain concept; no catch-all names.** `memory/feedback_folder_per_domain_concept_rule.md`
- **RULE 2 does NOT apply to probes/diagnostics/tools** (they may stay). `memory/feedback_rule2_exempts_probes_diagnostics_tools.md`
- **Test/probe flags live in `votv-coop.ini [dev]`, NOT bats/env.** `memory/feedback_test_flags_in_ini_not_bats_or_env.md`
- **`docs/piles/` is the LIVING pile KB** — mark DESIGN vs AS-BUILT vs VERIFIED. `memory/feedback_docs_piles_living_knowledge_base.md`

## 2. Join-window identity & the DUP-prone zone (measure before touching)

- **A client grab/drop of a host-owned keyed prop = a MOVE with TWO same-key halves** (SPAWN author + a
  co-fired grab-hook DESTROY); the DESTROY is usually the killer. *Look FIRST:* the destroy-seam, not the
  spawn author. `memory/lesson_client_keyed_prop_move_two_wire_halves.md`
- **A host OnSpawn log line != VISIBLE** — check the immediate same-tick OnDestroy (destroy-by-key kills
  the newest). `memory/lesson_onspawn_log_not_proof_check_immediate_destroy.md`
- **REUSE the proven author (with its gates), don't raw-reimplement** — a raw MarkPropElement broke the
  E-grab decline. `memory/lesson_reuse_proven_author_not_raw_reimpl.md`
- **A join reconcile that DESTROYS local actors needs a quiescence gate + caps.** `memory/feedback_join_reconcile_sweep_safety.md`
- **An op applied BEFORE the state it reads is ready recurs** — gate/defer (snapshot-before-state-ready). `memory/feedback_snapshot_before_state_ready.md`
- **chipPiles persist in `primitivesData`; off-kerfurs in `objectsData`** (different save lanes). `memory/lesson_chippile_saved_in_primitivesData_not_objectsData.md`
- **DELIVERY-axis: join DELIVERY vs IDENTITY are separate; ONE owner = `prop_snapshot`.** `memory/feedback_deliver_missing_owner_delivery_axis.md`

## 3. Sync architecture (owners, routers, lifecycle)

- **Follow MTA architecture when possible** (vendored `reference/mtasa-blue/`). `memory/feedback_follow_mta_architecture.md`
- **A new `ReliableKind` wires in THREE places** — check the router checklist. `memory/feedback_reliablekind_router_checklist.md`
- **Host TRACKING/enroll gates on HOSTING, never `connected()`.** `memory/lesson_tracking_gates_on_hosting_not_connected.md`
- **EVERY session-end path runs the FULL teardown fanout.** `memory/lesson_every_session_end_path_full_teardown_fanout.md`
- **Pre-world subsystems Install at StartCoopSession, NOT world-gated.** `memory/feedback_preworld_install_at_startcoopsession.md`
- **When a release VERB can't be caught, STREAM THROUGH the state.** `memory/lesson_stream_through_release_not_verb.md`
- **An e2e assert must DISCRIMINATE the axis it claims.** `memory/lesson_e2e_assert_must_discriminate_the_axis.md`
- **The join-window PropSnapPos POSITION reconcile is eid-generic at the receiver** — a new
  save-authoritative pos reconcile is SEND-SIDE ONLY (capture baseline + flush); the chip overlay
  auto-skips a non-chip eid, so no dup. *Look FIRST:* `FlushDivergedSavePositionsForSlot` +
  `UpdateChipHostPos`. `memory/lesson_pos_reconcile_generalizes_via_generic_receiver.md`

## 4. Dispatch, hooks & input seams

- **BP INNER calls (`EX_CallMath`/`EX_*`) BYPASS ProcessEvent** — a PE hook won't fire. `memory/lesson_ex_callmath_invisible_to_processevent.md`
- **A SCRIPT-fn called via `EX_Local*` is invisible to BOTH the PE hook AND the Func-patch** — patch the
  NATIVE calls inside it. `memory/lesson_script_fn_invisible_to_func_patch.md`
- **use-HOLD (`canBeUsedHold`) bypasses InputAction press-sims** — bind identity on the ENTITY-sim. `memory/lesson_use_hold_bypasses_press_seams.md`
- **An InputAction can have MULTIPLE delegate bindings — hook ALL.** `memory/lesson_input_action_multiple_delegate_bindings.md`
- **Every global `GetAsyncKeyState` hotkey poller gates on `!IsOverlayCapturingText()` too** — else it
  fires while the user types in chat (T then G triggered voice). `memory/lesson_hotkey_pollers_gate_on_overlay_text_capture.md`
- **A gated probe that "didn't fire": FIRST verify the GATE reads true.** `memory/lesson_gated_probe_verify_the_gate.md`

## 5. Engine / UE4 facts

- **NEVER raw-write a UE field the game sets via a setter UFunction** — call the setter. `memory/feedback_no_raw_write_of_setter_managed_fields.md`
- **UE `TArray<struct>` stride = 16-ALIGNED size, NOT the raw `Size:`.** `memory/feedback_tarray_stride_aligned_not_raw_size.md`
- **plain `IsLive` passes a RECYCLED slot** — cached instances need `IsLiveByIndex`. `memory/lesson_islive_recycled_slot_blind_use_by_index.md`
- **A runtime-spawned `AStaticMeshActor` is STATIC mobility** → set Movable BEFORE `SetActorLocation` (a
  Static root silently no-ops the teleport). `memory/lesson_runtime_staticmeshactor_must_be_movable.md`
- **SEH shields must NEVER absorb `0xC00000FD`** (stack overflow). `memory/lesson_never_absorb_stack_overflow.md`
- **A bare proxy can NEVER be `lookAtActor`** — use a camera-ray cone. `memory/lesson_proxy_never_lookatactor_use_camera_cone.md`

## 6. Assets, models, geometry

- **Curating GAME assets = census EVERY asset** — games ship broken leftovers. `memory/lesson_game_asset_census_before_curation.md`
- **`mainPlayer_C` renders TWO overlapping bodies — apply mesh to BOTH slots.** `memory/lesson_attachparent_visibility_two_body.md`
- **Cooked UE meshes store CW-outward winding — MEASURE + match** (signed volume). `memory/lesson_winding_match_template_signed_volume.md`
- **Porting SCS templates: copy behavior flags BIT-EXACTLY** (dormancy). `memory/lesson_template_faithful_scs_dormancy.md`
- **Anim nodes INSIDE a state contribute NOTHING when it exits** (post-BUA seam). `memory/lesson_animbp_state_hosted_nodes_post_bua_seam.md`
- **A learned per-bone profile is exact ONLY on its source skeleton — MEASURE fit.** `memory/lesson_converter_fit_measured_not_assumed.md`
- **NEVER strip geometry from a shipped model on geometric heuristics** (need visual proof). `memory/lesson_never_strip_shipped_geometry_without_visual_proof.md`
- **VOTV's own fonts:** `FSEX300` = Fixedsys Excelsior (font_terminal, pixel); `ShareTechMono` = font_ui
  (subtitles, Latin-only subset). `memory/reference_votv_fonts.md`

## 7. Performance

- **`GetActorLocation`/`GetComponentLocation` are UFunction DISPATCHES, not raw reads** — never bulk-call
  per-tick over thousands of actors (invisible on a fresh save, hitches the host on a mature world);
  throttle / pre-filter / read the raw transform. *Look FIRST:* `engine.cpp GetActorLocation`. `memory/lesson_getactorlocation_is_a_ufunction_dispatch.md`
- **Per-tick `GUObjectArray` walk: cheap class check BEFORE `NameOf`.** `memory/lesson_full_array_walk_cheap_filter_before_nameof.md`
- **A periodic FPS hitch by PERIOD COINCIDENCE is not causation** — measure the real source. `memory/lesson_periodic_hitch_not_the_walk_by_period_coincidence.md`
- **A fixed-capacity hook table + ASYMMETRIC roles = a half-working fix.** `memory/lesson_hook_table_capacity_asymmetric_peers.md`
- **ImGui COMPOSITE widgets: commit via a DEBOUNCE on value-changed.** `memory/lesson_imgui_composite_commit_debounce.md`

## 8. Build / deploy / git hygiene

- **`deploy-all.ps1` deploys Release** → ALWAYS build Release + hash-verify. `memory/lesson_deploy_sources_release_config_not_relwithdebinfo.md`
- **The smoke HOST slot `s_1234` is STATEFUL — restore `coop_backup` FIRST.** `memory/lesson_s1234_host_slot_stateful_coop_backup.md`
- **NEVER `git add -A`/`<dir>` over held WIP — explicit paths or stash.** `memory/lesson_never_git_add_A_over_held_wip.md`
- **AUTONOMOUS pile test loop harness** (reference). `memory/reference_pile_test_harness.md`

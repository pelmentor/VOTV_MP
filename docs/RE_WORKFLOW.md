# RE workflow — how to use UE4SS + tools/probes/ during development

CLAUDE.md RULE 3: the shipping mod is standalone (`xinput1_3.dll` + the versioned `multivoid-<game>-<build>.dll` payload, no UE4SS at runtime; the DLL was named `votv-coop.dll` before 2026-07-19 b122). **However, UE4SS is explicitly approved as a development tool.** This document captures the workflow we use to leverage UE4SS during reverse-engineering, hypothesis-testing, and rapid iteration — without ever shipping it.

The standalone constraint is preserved by having **three game copies** (2026-05-25 convention — see `tools/deploy-all.ps1`):

| Path | Role | UE4SS? | Used by | Use for |
|------|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `Game_0.9.0n_HOST/` | HOST | yes (legacy; coexists with our DLL via the dwmapi.dll.off rename) | user's hands-on host play | user-side hands-on testing as host; running `mp_host_game.bat` |
| `Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_1/` | CLIENT | no | user's hands-on client play | user-side hands-on testing as client; running `mp_client_connect.bat` |
| `Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_3/` | DEV | yes (UE4SS + dwmapi.dll active) | Claude (autonomous) | `lan-test.ps1` autonomous LAN tests, Live View RE work, Lua probes, BP graph dumping, hypothesis-testing via GUIUFunctionCaller |

Each copy keeps its OWN Saved/ directory (logs, screenshots, save games) so the autonomous LAN test in `_dev/` cannot collide with the user's host or client play state.

The HOST + CLIENT copies have only `xinput1_3.dll` + `multivoid-*.dll` (HOST also has UE4SS files left over from earlier setup but UE4SS is currently inactive there — `dwmapi.dll.off` is the disabled proxy). The DEV copy adds the active `dwmapi.dll` UE4SS proxy + `UE4SS.dll` + the Mods/ tree with default UE4SS Lua mods (ActorDumperMod, BPModLoaderMod, CheatManagerEnablerMod, ConsoleEnablerMod, etc.) + our own `coopTestHarness/` probe + `UE4SS.log`.

**Why two UE4SS-equipped copies (HOST + DEV)?** HOST has UE4SS legacy from earlier setup; it's not actively used during host play (dwmapi.dll.off = disabled). DEV's UE4SS IS active (dwmapi.dll present + active). If we ever want to clean HOST to a pure-standalone state, run `tools/deploy-loader.ps1 -GameWin64 .../Game_0.9.0n_HOST/Win64 -Standalone` which renames dwmapi.dll → dwmapi.dll.off.

**Deploying the DLL across all 3:** `tools/deploy-all.ps1` is the canonical multi-target script. Builds-then-deploys when run after `cmake --build`. The `lan-test.ps1` script auto-deploys to `_dev/` only.

## What UE4SS gives us for free

### 1. Live View (the GUI UObject inspector) — biggest win

UE4SS ships a Dear-ImGui-based GUI that lets you browse every UObject in `GUObjectArray`, expand any object's FProperty tree, and **edit values live**. It already runs in our DEV copy — `GuiConsoleEnabled = 1` + `GuiConsoleVisible = 1` in `UE4SS-settings.ini`. Press the dump-keybind to toggle the window.

**Use it for:**

- Picking a specific UObject by name (e.g., `mainPlayer_C` instance) and watching every field tick-by-tick as the game runs. Vital for diagnosing animation BlendSpace inputs (`spd`, `Velocity`, `Controller`, etc.) — would have caught the Controller=null issue from earlier today in seconds vs the multi-hour RE.
- Editing FProperty values directly to test hypotheses ("what if I set `AnimBP_kerfur_Controller` = my local PC?").
- Inspecting field offsets we suspect may have shifted between game versions.

### 2. GUIUFunctionCaller (2026-05-25: enabled)

Experimental UE4SS feature: lets you CALL any UFunction from the Live View GUI by clicking the function in the object's UFunction list and filling param values into form fields. Setting in `[ExperimentalFeatures] GUIUFunctionCaller = 1`.

**Use it for:**

- Test-firing UFunctions before we wire them in our DLL. E.g., before writing the storage-extract observer, click `propInventory_C` → call `takeObj(0, true)` from the GUI to see what actually happens.
- Validating ParamFrame marshaling: if the GUI call succeeds with `inString` but our reflection call fails with `InString`, we've found a param-name mismatch.

### 3. ObjectDumper (`F8` shortcut → dump all UObjects to file)

Dumps every UObject in `GUObjectArray` (~250k entries) to a text file at `UE4SS_ObjectDump_*.txt`. We have two snapshots already in the dev copy (`UE4SS_ObjectDump_MAIN_MENU.txt` and `UE4SS_ObjectDump_GAMEPLAY_SAVE.txt`).

**Use it for:**

- Discovering what UObjects exist in a given game state (main menu vs gameplay vs save-load transition).
- Finding the FNAME of a class we suspect exists but can't locate (e.g., "is there an `Aprop_storage_locker_C`?" — grep the dump).

### 4. CXX Header Generator (`F7` shortcut → dump all class layouts to cooked C++ headers)

The output is at `Game_0.9.0n_HOST/WindowsNoEditor/VotV/Binaries/Win64/CXXHeaderDump/*.hpp`. We already use this for offset derivation throughout `sdk_profile.h`. Re-dump after a VOTV update to re-derive offsets.

### 5. Lua probe scripting — `tools/probes/`

Our existing probes (`tools/probes/*.lua`) run inside the UE4SS Lua VM in the dev copy. They give us autonomous RE that doesn't require building C++ code.

**Use it for:**

- Listing every UFunction matching a pattern (e.g., all `On*` lifecycle hooks).
- Per-tick property dumps (e.g., AnimBP cached fields, prop holder state).
- Sanity-checking offsets the SDK dump claims.
- Cross-version validation: run the probe on a new VOTV build to spot offset shifts before they break our DLL.

### 6. BPModLoader (UE4SS bundled mod) — bytecode inspection

`BPModLoaderMod` exposes APIs to read compiled Blueprint bytecode. Lets us read the actual BP graph of a UFunction (vs inferring from the header signature).

**Use it for:**

- Understanding what a BP UFunction actually does at the bytecode level. Critical for the upcoming Phase 5N1 NPC sync (14 NPC BP classes to RE) and the events system (~80 events).

## Open-source-borrow strategy (RULE 3-clean)

We **port** reflection patterns + AOB signatures from UE4SS's open-source repo (`reference/RE-UE4SS/`) into our standalone `src/votv-coop/src/ue_wrap/reflection.cpp` — with attribution. Not depend on at runtime.

**Examples of patterns worth porting:**

- AOB signatures for `GUObjectArray`, `GNames`, `ProcessEvent`, `StaticFindObject` across many UE4 versions (UE4SS has battle-tested these).
- FProperty traversal algorithms (UE4SS handles every FProperty subtype; ours currently handles the common ones).
- FName decoder logic (UE4SS handles all the FName encoding variants including UTF-16 names).

The porting workflow:
1. Read the relevant UE4SS source (`reference/RE-UE4SS/UE4SS/src/SigScanner/*.cpp` or `reference/RE-UE4SS/UE4SS/src/UnrealVersionedContainer/UnrealVersion.cpp`).
2. Adapt the algorithm into our standalone `ue_wrap/` style (no UE4SS types, no UE4SS headers).
3. Test with a Lua probe in the dev copy to confirm parity.
4. Comment in our source with `// Algorithm adapted from RE-UE4SS (MIT-licensed); see reference/RE-UE4SS/...`.

## What we don't borrow

- UE4SS's runtime mod loader — we have our own (proxy DLL → `multivoid-*.dll`).
- UE4SS's BPModLoader pak-mounting — Phase 7+ revisit only (see `docs/MULTIPLAYER_UI.md` + the 3 architecture findings docs from 2026-05-25).
- UE4SS's Lua VM — we don't need scripting in production; if we ever need it for chat commands etc., a tiny embedded interpreter (e.g., MyJS or a custom DSL) keeps the standalone DLL self-contained.
- UE4SS's UI framework (Dear ImGui via UE4SS) — useful for the future MP menu debug overlay (CLAUDE.md "Mod menu / debug overlay: Dear ImGui (UE4SS ships an ImGui integration)") but that integration is via OUR linked ImGui, not via UE4SS at runtime.

## The "three copies" hygiene rule

**Always deploy to all 3 copies via `tools/deploy-all.ps1`** when iterating on the shipping DLL. The script copies the build's xinput1_3.dll + the versioned multivoid payload into all the Win64 directories (and deletes stale/legacy payload names). Without it, the user's hands-on host/client play may run a stale DLL while my dev copy has the new one — confusing.

**Never** assume what works in the DEV copy will also work in the user-play copies. UE4SS's presence in DEV changes the load order (UE4SS hooks `ProcessEvent` before we do; the global `GUObjectArray` cache is populated by UE4SS at startup; some classes are loaded earlier because UE4SS forces them). The CLIENT copy is the source of truth for "does our shipping DLL work standalone?".

The `lan-test.ps1` autonomous test runs against `Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_3/` ONLY for both host and client instances — they share that one Win64 directory and discriminate by env vars. This is intentional: the LAN test is for VERIFYING the coop pipeline works, not for proving the standalone-no-UE4SS path (the user's hands-on play on `Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_1/` does that).

## Future RE sessions: open Live View first

The session-resume rule (CLAUDE.md "Reading order after a session reset"): we read MEMORY.md + the latest project checkpoint + CLAUDE.md before starting work.

Add a step for RE-heavy sessions: **launch the DEV copy with UE4SS, open Live View, find the relevant UObject, before writing the first line of code.** The 5-10 minutes spent setting up the inspector pays for itself in the first hypothesis check.

Examples:
- Puppet anim RE: open Live View → expand `mainPlayer_C` → expand its `AnimInstance` → watch `Pawn`, `Controller`, `Movement`, `Character`, `spd`, `Velocity` live as you walk. The Controller=null issue from 2026-05-25 would have been visible in one frame.
- Storage extract RE: open Live View → expand `propInventory_C` → call `takeObj` from the GUIUFunctionCaller → inspect the returned actor's Key field directly.
- NPC sync RE: Live View → filter by `*kerfur*` → see the spawner-spawn relationships, the active-tick states, the per-instance variant divergences.

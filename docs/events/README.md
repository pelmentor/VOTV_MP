# docs/events/ — the per-event coop knowledge base

One doc per VOTV event SCENARIO (user rule 2026-07-04): each event's native behavior, its
coop sync design, and its caveats live in that event's own file here. This folder answers
"what exactly happens during event X and how does coop deliver it to every peer" — the
cross-cutting CONTRACTS stay where they are:

- `docs/COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md` — the join-during-event contract (EventSnapshot AS-BUILT v98,
  the per-lane late-join table, phases). Per-event docs LINK to it; they do not restate
  it. A new event's registrant class also gets an `event_active_sync::kClassRowMap` entry
  (unmapped classes WARN LOUD on a joiner — that log line is the fill signal).
- `src/votv-coop/src/coop/world/event_fire_sync.cpp` — the replay/no-replay dupe matrix
  is AUTHORITY in code (kReplayRows/kNoReplayRows). A per-event doc cites its row's
  verdict; changing a verdict changes the CODE first, the doc second.
- `research/findings/votv-event-system-RE-2026-06-13.md` — the runEvent dispatcher RE
  (all 69 list_events rows' concrete outputs). Durable ground truth; per-event docs cite
  it instead of re-deriving.
- `research/findings/votv-active-events-registry-RE-2026-07-04.md` — the native
  activeEvents registry (lib_C::setEvent refcount + senders; the ~95-class census).

## Doc skeleton (copy for a new event)

```markdown
# <event name> — <one-line what the player sees>   (STATUS: DESIGN | AS-BUILT | VERIFIED)

## 1. Native behavior (ground truth)
   list_events row(s) / trigger; actor class(es); the full scenario timeline; every
   externally visible effect. Tag every claim [wiki] / [bytecode fn] / [live log] / [?].
## 2. Sync-axis table
   | axis | deterministic-from-start / host-random / per-viewer | carried by (lane/wire) |
## 3. Coop design
   What is mirrored, by which lane; what replays natively; what is host-local. Cite the
   dupe-matrix verdict + the late-join answer (COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md 3.4 row).
## 4. Caveats / known quirks
   Native bugs, save/reload interactions, timing races, what autonomy can't verify.
## 5. Verification
   What was proven, HOW (smoke line / hands-on / matching real log), what remains.
```

A "sync-axis" is one externally-visible state stream (position, anim phase, sound cue,
sub-spawn, decal...). The table forces the design decision per axis instead of a vague
"mirror the event".

## THE METHOD (user rule 2026-07-04): granular, every single event

**Going through every event the game has, one by one, is the only way events get synced.**
No event is "covered" by a blanket mechanism claim; each one gets its own granular pass:

1. **Doc** it here (all 5 skeleton sections; wiki + bytecode ground truth, tagged).
2. **Verify** its dupe-matrix verdict against the RE (the piramid pass PROVED this step
   earns its keep: `piramid` sat in kReplayRows, but replay = a divergent client-local
   pyramid — the verdict was WRONG and only the granular dig caught it).
3. **Design + build** the sync where a gap exists; extend the COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md 3.4
   late-join row.
4. **Verify** live (autonomy for flow, hands-on for visuals) and stamp the doc's status.

An event counts as DONE only when its doc says VERIFIED with the evidence named.

## Master tracker

The inventory is enumerated in three places (do not re-derive): the 69 `list_events` rows
(`votv-event-system-RE-2026-06-13.md` section 10 — every row's concrete output), the
~95 `setEvent` registrant classes (`votv-active-events-registry-RE-2026-07-04.md` census),
and the wiki taxonomy (Story Mode / Ariral-reputation / signal-triggered / random / dreams
/ player-activated / time-related / endings — voicesofthevoid.wiki.gg/wiki/Events).

| Event (row / class) | Doc | Granular pass |
|---|---|---|
| piramid (`piramid2_C`) — devs'-gauntlet acceptance case | [piramid.md](piramid.md) | AS-BUILT v104 (07-05 arc, 7 rounds: tracking `ff338d87` [V] -> [WA-TRACE] -> v99 SCALE [V «идёт»] -> v100 auxYaw facing [user: «хороший результат»] -> gather SUCK `7ec1f666` **[V by user: «засасывание зеркально 100%»]** -> v102 idle-relLook stream `a255b70f` [user: «маленько рассинхронится»] -> **v104 wispTarget-IDENTITY stream `d0d3af1f`** — the walk-phase CHASE branch now runs both ends). Pending: 0y-v104 head re-verdict + TRUE mid-join (11:25 was join-before-event) |
| alarm (`trigger_alarm_C`) — the 07-05 user join-pass ask | [alarm.md](alarm.md) | AS-BUILT v101 (2026-07-05, same day as the ask): the BASE siren + red lamps (distinct from the local per-terminal radar beep -- user rule 07-05). Full static RE (ON census exhaustive: analogD radar scan on an important comp_radarPoint -- the indirection events use -- + the snuskLoaf prank; OFF = panel_radar "b/Stop alarm"; runTrigger natively idempotent) -> `alarm_sync` lane (1 Hz active-bit poll both peers — runTrigger is EX_VirtualFunction, PE-invisible — host broadcasts transitions, client forwards local ones, apply = reflected runTrigger full-native-fanout) + join answer (unconditional connect snapshot) + the unmapped-WARN hole closed via kLaneOwnedClasses. **Autonomous e2e PASS 2026-07-05 13:50 incl. the MID-ALARM JOIN case** (ON landed pre-world-ready -> connect snapshot delivered it; live OFF same-second). Pending: hands-on for siren/lamps + a client-originated stop |
| obelisk (`obelisk_C`) — Phase 0 registry-probe exemplar | (todo) | BEGIN/END proven live; doc pending |
| wisps (`wisp_C` swarm) + killerwisp — creature lanes shipped 07-03 | (todo) | AS-BUILT in code; doc = record the verdicts |
| starRain (`skyFallingEvent`) — event_cue lane | (todo) | late-join gap CLOSED 2026-07-05 (event_cue join re-send, e2e PASS -- COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md 3.4); doc pending |
| everything else (65 rows + non-row registrants) | — | queue below |

Non-event sibling doc: [radar-terminal-alert.md](radar-terminal-alert.md) — the computer's
per-terminal beep/ping/blip (the OTHER thing "alarm" gets called; user rule 2026-07-05:
never conflate with the base alarm). Per-viewer local by design, no lane; lives here so
the alarm reader finds the distinction next door.

Queue order = the wiki Story Mode ladder first (the scheduled spectacles every save hits:
warning obelisk D25, black-hole sun D27, piramid D31, rozital scouts D33, mothership D38,
gray firetank D44, gray invasion D47), then signal-triggered + Ariral-reputation, then
creature controllers (lane-covered — docs record verdicts), then pranks/ambience
(mostly host-local by design). Each finished doc adds its row to this table.

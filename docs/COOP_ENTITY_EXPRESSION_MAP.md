## Identity ranges (all families)

`coop::element::Registry`: **HOST eids = `[1, kHostRangeSize=32768)`; CLIENT/peer eids = `[32768, …)`**.
`IsAllowedHostAllocatedEid` / `IsAllowedPeerAllocatedEid` are the trust gates; every wire receiver is
host-authoritative (`senderPeerSlot != 0` ⇒ drop, except the either-range cases — PropDestroy/PropConvert).
**[V]** (`kHostRangeSize` literal is in `coop/element/registry.h`).

## The families at a glance

| Family | Spawn dispatch | Caught by | Identity | Module(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Keyed `Aprop_C` props | save-load / spawner / Q-menu (BeginDeferred) / takeObj | seed walk (save-loaded) · Init-POST observer (spawner) · `FinishSpawningActor` POST (Q-menu) · takeObj POST | host eid **+ the BP save Key string** | prop_lifecycle, prop_element_tracker, prop_snapshot, host_spawn_watcher |
| chipPile (ambient trash pile) | garbagePileSpawner-seeded / save-load | seed walk (keyless-pile lane) → connect snapshot / R1 re-seed | **host eid only (KEYLESS)**; the JOIN reconcile of the client's save-loaded native ↔ host proxy is **by SAVE-TIME POSITION** (v86 Path 1c — the frozen value both peers loaded; matched at the POST-QUIESCENCE sweep, NOT world-ready, because world-ready ≠ the native load-tail finished) **[BUILT, audit GO ×2, hands-on take-2 PENDING]** | prop_element_tracker (CollectTrackedPileTransforms), save_transfer (g_blobPileXforms), prop_snapshot (stamp matchX/Y/Z), **coop/props/pile_spawn_bind** (TryDestroyTwin -- the spawn-time twin-destroy) + **coop/element/quiescence_drain** (SweepReconcileSaveTimeTwins -- the post-quiescence retry; was `pile_reconcile`, split 2026-06-30) |

## Per-family detail

### Keyed Aprop_C props
- **Spawn→catch:** save-loaded placed props are caught by the one-shot/throttled **GUObjectArray seed walk**
  (`SeedKnownKeyedProps`/`ReSeedKnownKeyedProps`), NOT the Init-POST observer **[V/RD]**; spawner-spawned
  props DO fire the **Init-POST observer** (`GrabObserver_Aprop_Init_POST_Body`) **[V]**; Q-menu/toolgun
  BeginDeferred spawns are caught at **`FinishSpawningActor` POST** (their `init()` is BP-internal →
  Init-POST never fires) **[V]**; container `takeObj` is caught at **takeObj POST** (the nested Init defers
  via `g_takeObjInFlight`) **[V]**.
- **Identity:** the **BP save Key string** is the cross-peer id (the game mints it via `NewGuid`; we READ it,
  and on a receiver write the host's Key via `setKey` before FinishSpawningActor) **[V/RD]**; a host eid
  rides alongside.
- **Client never authors a save-loaded Aprop_C** (`prop_lifecycle.cpp:193` `IsDescendantOfProp → return`) —
  host-authoritative. **[V]**
- **Destroy:** engine `K2_DestroyActor` **PRE** → `PropDestroy(key,eid)` **[V]**; BP-internal vanishes
  (truck/cull/LifeSpan, EX_CallMath) → the host **reaper death-watch** (`ReapDeadLocalPropElements` →
  explicit `PropDestroy(eid)`, kerfur-skipped) **[V]**.
- **Connect reconcile:** R2 blob-vs-live key-diff deletes → SnapshotBegin/claim-tracking → bracketed
  PropSpawn stream → SnapshotComplete → quiescence-gated **divergence sweep** (membership = the client's
  own local Prop Elements, mirror-excluded; **>50% world-wipe valve**) → `EnsurePileBindIndex` position-bind
  for keyless piles (retires the client-local identity). **[V]**

**Durable facts (survive the redesign):**
- **chipPile is KEYLESS** — `setKey` is a no-op; the only identity is the host-minted eid. **[V/RD]**
  Caught by the seed-walk keyless-pile lane (`IsChipPile`) → connect snapshot / R1 re-seed. **[V]**
- **IDENTITY MECHANISM UPDATE (2026-06-27/28, sync-consolidation refactor) [RD]:** Prop identity is now ONE
  owner end-to-end — `element::Registry` (the unified `actor→eid` reverse `EidForActor`) + the
  `coop::element::CreateOrAdoptPropMirror` bind keystone. THREE leaked satellites are now DELETED:
  `g_propElementsById` (earlier), `g_boundMirrorNatives` (the is-save-native SET → now `Element::IsSaveNative`,
  `066d0a49`), and `g_actorToPropElementId` (the locals-only actor→eid map → now `EidForActor`, `6aeaf55c`;
  `GetPropElementIdForActor` re-imposes the locals-only contract with an `IsMirror` filter, and idempotency is
  now safer — it also blocks minting a local over a live mirror, a dup the old map couldn't see).
  `RegisterPropMirror` is now a thin forwarder to `CreateOrAdoptPropMirror` (`ecdc527c`). (2) "is this actor a
  bound save-loaded native" (`IsBoundMirrorNative`) resolves `actor→eid` via `EidForActor` → `IsSaveNative()` +
  liveness — atomic with the binding, can never read stale (was the 15:01:49 D1 root). (3) The join reconcile
  (twin-retire / variant-1 / b3 / deferred-destroy / kerfur-retire) is NO LONGER a join-window one-shot: it is the ONE
  order owner `coop/element/quiescence_drain::RunReconcile` (was `identity_reconcile::RunIdentityReconcile`, consolidated
  2026-06-30), driven by the join sweep AND a steady trigger (`OnTick`: pending-twin/b3/destroy/kerfur work OR a 6s
  post-purge window) AND the >50% valve-ABORT path.
  Commits `ce132e0d`/`066d0a49`/`47384057`/`432183ce`/`8b85cb2e`/`ecdc527c`/`6aeaf55c`. **VERIFIED real log
  16:06 2026-06-28: fix #1 (valve-abort reconcile, 242 RE-BIND) + fix #2 (post-purge window, 13 fires) BOTH
  fired, world clean.** Keystone (CreateOrAdopt + satellite retires) build GREEN. NOT-yet-hands-on: D1
  grab-no-dup, D2 kerfur-no-flash (the interaction scenarios). See [[project-sync-module-refactor-2026-06-27]].
- **VERIFIED mechanic (bytecode):** `actorChipPile_C` = CARRY-AND-THROW (E → `playerGrabbed` spawns a
  clump in hand + destroys the pile; the clump re-piles on its **2nd ground contact** at the clump's
  **sphere-traced RESTING point** — NOT `lastPos`, NOT the source pile pos → why proximity was doomed).
  `trashBitsPile_C` = a SEPARATE COLLECT entity (keyed-Aprop lane). Only `chipType@0x0238` (cosmetic
  variant) carries. **[V/RD]**
- **OBSERVABILITY (corrected 2026-06-21):** `playerGrabbed`/`pickupObjectDirect`/`K2_DestroyActor(self)` are
  INVISIBLE (`EX_LocalVirtualFunction`). **The clump-spawn (grab) + the pile-respawn (re-pile) are ALSO
  INVISIBLE** — the chipPile/clump ubergraphs issue `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`/`FinishSpawningActor`
  as **`EX_CallMath`** (a native thunk below ProcessEvent). `host_spawn_watcher` catches that UFunction only
  from the NATIVE/SPAWNER caller (pinecone/`garbagePileSpawner`); for the BP-ubergraph caller it logged **0
  fires** (870 piles + every re-pile, hands-on 2026-06-21, commit `0e56ca39`). **Visibility is the CALLER's
  opcode, not the callee.** The 2026-06-08 `pass2` RE had this RIGHT; the s35 "BeginDeferred observable"
  reversal was the regression. `WorldContextObject == EX_Self` (the source) is bytecode-confirmed for both
  transitions; it is READ via a `UFunction::Func` thunk patch (AS-BUILT, `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`, commit
  `d19ae4d4` — the thunk reads `FFrame::Object`@0x18 = `EX_Self`), NOT a ProcessEvent observer.
  **[V: COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md "Catching an EX_CallMath call"; host_spawn_watcher.cpp:118-122;
  research/findings/votv-chippile-dispatch-and-thunk-hook-RE-2026-06-21.md]**

**The design (08, host-authoritative state machine):** the eid is a host-minted life-stable logical trash
entity (state PILED/HELD_BY(N)/FLYING; **position is NEVER identity for the GRAB** → the cluster mis-bind is
impossible by construction). Host owns the authoritative state; receivers drive a local visual from it.
Client-grab = **camera-ray cone recognition + `GrabIntent` → host executes the real verb on puppet-N + a
host-AUTH per-eid carry pose stream + `ThrowIntent`** (the FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness], proto v85,
HEAD `29353191`; see the Increment-2 bullet below). A sync-time-context byte rejects stale packets.
- **GRAB (pile→clump) — [V] VERIFIED hands-on (`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`), proto v82, commit `0e56ca39`:**
  `trash_collect_sync::OnPileGrabPre` (the `InpActEvt_use` PRE — a real input event, ProcessEvent-VISIBLE)
  records the aimed pile's eid (`trash_channel::NotePendingGrab`); `local_streams`' held-edge adopts the
  spawned clump onto E (`AdoptPendingGrabClump → trash_channel::OnHostConvert(kToClump)`). Identity is the
  host eid end-to-end; NO proximity.
- **RE-PILE (clump→pile) — [AS-BUILT], the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter (commit
  `d19ae4d4`):** a transparent forwarder patched onto `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`'s `Func`
  (`UFunction+0xD8`, via `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`) fires on the clump's `EX_CallMath` re-pile spawn →
  `OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve` reads `FFrame::Object`(@0x18 = source clump = `EX_Self`) + `*Result`(= new
  pile); a TRACKED clump → `OnHostConvert(kToPile)` converts E onto the EXACT spawned pile the SAME tick →
  the client re-skins its ONE mirror (no destroy+spawn dupe). **Zero proximity, no reaper race.** Detection
  VERIFIED hands-on (read-only `B7EEB1BF`: thunk `*Result` ptr-for-ptr == the old death-watch's pile); the
  CONVERT flip is now VERIFIED [V hands-on take-30] (re-pile + rotation correct at the land-settle COMMIT). The
  proximity death-watch (`WatchClumpForRepile` /
  `FindNearestUntrackedChipPile_`) is RETIRED (RULE 2). **Former known-minor [RESOLVED]:** the ~5s
  vanish-return (reaper-vs-rebind) is gone by construction (the convert lands the new pile under E the same
  tick the clump dies). RE: `research/findings/votv-chippile-dispatch-and-thunk-hook-RE-2026-06-21.md` §3/§6.
- **GRAB-via-thunk + the eid=0 adopt-miss close — [DESIGN], NOT built:** move the grab (pile→clump) to the
  same thunk (srcObj = tracked chipPile → kToClump), retiring the InpActEvt-PRE + held-edge adopt and
  catching the grab even when the PRE missed (an UNTRACKED clump currently skips the converter). A tightening.
- **Increment 2 (CLIENT-grab direction) — the FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness]. proto v85, HEAD
  `29353191`, deployed `BB94A120A969A51E` (push held).** A client AIMS at a mirrored pile, GRABS, CARRIES,
  THROWS, it re-piles — all verified (0 CRITICAL fail) via the REAL E-press path.
  - **Recognition = a CAMERA-RAY CONE** (`trash_proxy::EidForAimedPileProxy`) in `OnPileGrabPre` — picks the
    most-centered pile proxy on the view-camera forward. The "suppress-native + read `lookAtActor`/
    `lookatActorCurrent`" plan + the proxy QueryOnly collision are **RETIRED (RULE 2)**: a bare AStaticMeshActor
    proxy can NEVER be `lookAtActor` (the `int_player_C` filter at LookAtFunction @3250) AND the worn pile mesh
    has no simple collision body (harness `trace-gate hit=0`). No suppress-native needed (the proxy fails the
    native cast on its own). E-press TOGGLES grab vs throw via the client carry-state.
    `[[lesson-proxy-never-lookatactor-use-camera-cone]]`
  - **Carry visibility = a NEW host-authoritative per-eid pose stream** (`MsgType::TrashCarryPose=34`,
    `TrashClumpPoseSnapshot` 32B, the `StoreRemoteWorldActorBatch` pattern). A client only drives pose slot 0
    + the relay never echoes to the origin, so the host-driven puppet-held clump's pose MUST be host-
    originated; every client drives the proxy via a per-eid `ActiveDrive` interp (`coop/trash_clump_pose_stream`,
    `coop/puppet_carry_drive::Tick` publishes carry + flight). Scales to N simultaneous client grabs.
  - **Throw** = `OnThrowIntent` releases the puppet grab (the re-pile gate reads not-held) + applies physics
    velocity along the puppet aim → the clump flies (flight stream) + self-re-piles via its own ground-hit
    thunk → ToPile. `ThrowIntentPayload` is eid-only (the host derives the direction).
  - **Abort (audit HIGH fix)** = a clump lost mid-carry → `ReleaseClientHold` broadcasts `PropDestroy(eid)`
    so clients retire the frozen proxy + `ClearClientCarry` (else the client was stuck in throw-mode forever).
  - The interp was EXTRACTED to `coop/active_drive.h` (remote_prop 1375→1222, RULE 2026-05-25; carry
    regression confirms zero behaviour change). Finding:
    `research/findings/votv-increment2-clientgrab-FULL-CHAIN-AS-BUILT-2026-06-23.md`. **NEXT (greenlight):**
    a `garbageCollider`-analog SHAPE component on the proxy for occlusion-correct aim + movement-block (the
    cone ignores walls; the proxy is still walk-through).
- **CLIENT MIRROR of trash = a host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` PROXY — DUP-FIX (derived) + VISIBILITY +

  proto v83:** the client's mirror of a chipPile/clump is NO LONGER the real self-morphing BP — it is an
  `AStaticMeshActor` WE own (`coop/trash_proxy`): NO blueprint (never self-morphs), `AddToRoot` (never GC'd →
  never stale-index), our eid→actor registry (`g_proxies`), re-skin (`SetStaticMesh`) IN PLACE on convert
  (never spawn-fresh). **Spawn** = `trash_proxy::SpawnProxy` (caught at the `OnSpawn` trash-class branch,
  BEFORE the BP dedup); **identity** = the eid in `g_proxies` + the Prop mirror (`RegisterPropMirror`);
  **re-skin** = `OnConvert` → `IsProxy(E)` → `ReskinProxy`; **destroy** = `OnDestroy`/disconnect →
  `RetireProxy` (`DestroyActor → RemoveFromRoot → unbind`). The proxy's `UStaticMeshComponent` is set
  **Movable** (`SetComponentMobility`, `245148c6`) because a runtime `AStaticMeshActor` defaults to STATIC, on
  which `SetStaticMesh`/`SetActorLocation` silently no-op. This **closed the former OPEN client
  mirror-staleness dup** (a real-BP join-mirror went NOT-LIVE within ~10s → `ResolveLiveActorByEid` null →
  fresh-clump spawn + the original lingering = the dup) — now impossible BY CONSTRUCTION (the 3-verdict
  discriminator / health-poll / serial-check plan is DROPPED as moot); the dup-gone + the resting/landed-pile
  mirror are **hands-on confirmed [V]**. **The LIVE CARRY-FREEZE is [V] FIXED hands-on** via the **`!carrying`
  release-edge gate** in `local_streams.cpp` (`else if (g_lastHeldProp &&
  !coop::trash_channel::IsCarrying(g_lastHeldEid))`) — the client clump UPDATES through the carry now (no freeze
  between E-events). The earlier "carry MIRRORS on a settled join / the failure was the JOIN RACE" claim was
  **WITHDRAWN as FALSE**; the actual release-edge cause was **`updateHold` PUPPET RECREATION** (the `heldActor`
  ptr changes with `pendingSettle=0`), NOT a contact-re-pile churn — which is why the `carrying &&
  HasPendingSettle` gate (`C9F28176`/commit `16ac153f`) FAILED and suppressing the WHOLE carry (`!carrying`) is
  the fix. **Host carries FINE** (native); **OTHER props mirror fine** (pose-stream). **NOW FIXED/BUILT this
  session:** (1) carry **JANK — FIXED [V hands-on]** (shipped `df158728`): the `key.len=4`→keyless theory was DISPROVEN
  by bytecode (BP `GetKey` returns the FName `"None"` for BOTH `prop_garbageClump_C` and `actorChipPile_C`, so
  `key.len=4` is the literal string "None"; the receiver already guards `keyW != "None"`→eid at
  `remote_prop.cpp:403`, so forcing keyless was a no-op). REAL root (code-proven): an interpolation
  PHASE-STALL — `BeginLerpToPose` set `lerpStartMs=nowMs`, `AdvanceLerp` sampled the same `nowMs` → alpha=0
  every new-pose tick at vsync-60. FIX = fixed-delay snapshot interpolation (`remote_prop.cpp` ActiveDrive
  buffers 2 timestamped poses prevLoc/lastLoc + prevPoseMs/lastPoseMs; renders `nowMs-span` behind; alpha by
  real timestamps; MTA `CClientVehicle` shape). User hands-on: carry now SMOOTH like a normal object. (2) proxy
  **SCALE — AS-BUILT** (shipped `df158728`, proto v82→v83; the COMMIT re-reads `GetActorScale3D`): the prior
  "`PropConvertPayload` has `scaleX/Y/Z` @protocol.h:2208" was WRONG (that was `PropSpawnPayload`); added
  `scaleX/Y/Z` to `PropConvertPayload` (static_assert 100→112), `BroadcastConvert` sends per-form
  `GetActorScale3D(newActor)`, new `ue_wrap::engine::SetActorScale3D`, the proxy applies it via `ApplyProxyScale`
  (guarded >0.001) in `SpawnProxy`+`ReskinProxy`; not separately eyeballed (covered by the commit re-read).
  (2b) pile-landing **ROTATION + throw SOUND — FIXED [V hands-on take-30]:** rot is re-read from the SETTLED
  pile at the land-settle COMMIT (`trash_channel.cpp:248`; the thunk passes the clump as a fallback
  `trash_collect_sync.cpp:91`); the pickup-cue-on-throw is killed (the flight branch streams the carry key
  without a re-StartDrive + a trash eid sends NO PropRelease; `OnHostRelease` RETIRED, RULE 2). (2c) the
  **Z/HEIGHT regression arc — FIXED [V harness]:** take-31 read the pile transform from `newActor` at the
  BeginDeferred POST = `(0,0,0)` (pile unpositioned pre-FinishSpawning) → derived piles snapped to world origin;
  the take-32 FIX re-reads the pile's REAL transform at the land-settle COMMIT (`trash_channel.cpp:248-256`),
  harness client-render-matches-host drift=0cm; the native-destroy was INNOCENT (harness-confirmed), the bug was
  the `(0,0,0)` loc. (3) **ORPHAN dup — SPLIT by pile origin; the DESTROY is now BUILT + VERIFIED [V harness].**
  DERIVED (gameplay-born) piles: dup GONE [V hands-on] (born only as a host convert → a proxy on both sides, no
  native twin). ORIGINAL (level-placed) piles: the client's NATIVE level-loaded chipPile coexisted with the
  host proxy (root CONFIRMED: level-piles get an eid+proxy via the eidOnly lane; the divergence sweep is BLIND
  to natives) — now `remote_prop_spawn.cpp:387-410` DESTROYS the co-located native at a pile proxy-spawn (exact
  ~1cm + chipType + IsLiveByIndex; exact-or-skip on >1; graceful on 0 matches; GATED on `g_claimTrackingActive`
  = the join bracket only; harness dup-destroy-clean 12 twins / 0 SKIP). NOT adopt (adopt re-introduces the BP
  self-morph the proxy avoids). The read-only PILE-PROBE that confirmed coexistence is REPLACED by this destroy
  (RULE 2, retired). (Supersedes the prior "eid-resolve race / `isProxy=0` spawn-fresh" theory — it was native
  coexistence.) (3b) **FPS — the ~4s stutter FIXED [V harness]:** `net_pump.cpp:559` guards the steady-world
  re-seed on the GUObjectArray high-water mark (NumObjects) + a ~20s safety census, so the ~237k-object walk is
  SKIPPED at rest; harness fps-reseed-rate 0.073/s (was ~0.25/s every 4s). (4) **the `simulateDrop`
  throw-velocity FLIP is DEAD — REPLACED by carry/flight stream-continuity; the THROW ARC is VERIFIED [V
  hands-on take-29 + harness]** (shipped `136ed779`): both the `simulateDrop` thunk AND its successor
  `dropGrabObject` thunk fired ZERO times across 7 grab/release cycles (the clump release uses NEITHER verb —
  the clump rides `grabbing_actor`, the PHC handle, not `holding_actor`) though the same Func-thunk facility
  fired all run; verb-detection ABANDONED. PIVOT: the throw needs no verb/velocity — the host's thrown clump
  really flies (physics) until it re-piles, so `local_streams.cpp`'s release-edge `!carrying`-SKIP branch now
  CONTINUES streaming `g_lastHeldProp`'s pose under the same eid E while it is a LIVE garbageClump (`IsLive` is
  the churn/flight discriminator — a churn re-pile kills the clump → skip; a real release leaves it flying →
  stream); the client's fixed-delay interp shows the arc; it ends when the clump re-piles (ToPile
  re-skins+snaps). The arc FLIES (user: "дуга ЛЕТИТ"; the autotest now does a real DIRECTIONAL throw). The dead
  `dropGrabObject` read-only thunk (`trash_collect_sync.cpp:45,99-126,396`) is STILL PRESENT — to be retired
  RULE 2 next.
  **Dead ends:** **Option 1** (`8bc797ef`,
  `SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false)` on the held clump) BUILT + FAILED — the live host BP re-arms hit-notify.
  **Option 2 (DISPROVEN by bytecode, NOT pending):** the `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate is DEAD — `holdPlayer`
  (`@0x0240 AmainPlayer_C*`, CXXHeaderDump-confirmed) is set ONCE on grab (`actorChipPile.json` @8492) and
  NEVER cleared in any BP, so it cannot mark "released." (CLOSE-B latch + land-settle SHIPPED `65AD883A` —
  correct, not the freeze cause.) **Phase 1 = visual + position + re-skin, EXPLICIT NoCollision**; collision
  (the `garbageCollider` hull) is PHASE 2 with Increment 2. Design + AS-BUILT:
  `research/findings/votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`; the carry root + fix (the
  canonical doc): `research/findings/votv-chippile-carry-churn-holdplayer-gate-2026-06-22.md`; the autonomous
  harness: `[[reference-pile-test-harness]]`. **STILL OPEN (NEXT):** a `garbageCollider`-analog SHAPE component
  on the proxy (occlusion-correct aim + movement-block — the client-grab camera cone ignores walls, the proxy
  is walk-through); the WHOOSH throw sound (no ReliableKind; user-deprioritized, best confirmed by hearing);
  retire the dead `dropGrabObject` read-only thunk (RULE 2); the `event_dispatch_trash.cpp` extraction.
  (Increment 2 client-grab FULL CHAIN is AS-BUILT v85 — see the dedicated bullet above.)
  **[V hands-on: dup-fix(derived) + visibility + carry-freeze + carry-JANK + throw-arc + rotation + sound; V harness: Z-fix + level-pile dup-DESTROY + FPS-fix; SCALE AS-BUILT; option 2 DISPROVEN.]**

### NPCs / Characters
- Host `BeginDeferred` **interceptor** (allowlist of 15 ACharacter bases) allocs an `Npc` Element + POST
  binds the actor; **client suppresses its own** local spawn (zero ReturnValue + return true) and
  materializes from the wire (`OnEntitySpawn`). Save-loaded twins (`savePersisted=1`) → **deferred adoption**
  by class+nearest-pose (never by key — the key is random per peer). Pose via `EntityPose` batch (>31
  tracked → fair-share rotation at the publisher, the MTA far-sync shape). Destroy
  via `K2_DestroyActor` PRE → `EntityDestroy`; a bound actor found dead in the pose walk (PE-invisible
  self-destroy) → `SyncDestroyedNpcByEid` retire + `EntityDestroy` (2026-07-03). **[V]**

### wisp_C (the wispSwarm-event swarm — the EX_CallMath NPC; 2026-07-03, smoke 32/32×4 legs)
- **Spawn dispatch is `EX_CallMath` BeginDeferred** from `trigger_wispSwarm_2`'s ubergraph (up to 32, one
  per 0.25–1.0 s, annulus 500–750 m out / 500 m up) — the PE interceptor+POST NEVER fire. Caught by the
  **`ufunction_hook` Func-thunk** on the same UFunction (chains after trash_collect's), **SOURCE-GATED by
  `FFrame::Object`'s class == `trigger_wispSwarm_C`**, queued (fires PRE-Finish, transform unset), enrolled
  at the next pose tick (`npc_world_enum::DrainPendingExSpawns` → the shared `EnrollUntrackedNpcActor`). **[V smoke]**
- **AMBIENT wisp_C stays per-peer local by design** (ticker_wispSpawner's table is wisp_C weight 100 of
  ~108): the source-gate excludes it and the world-enum walk skips untracked wisp_C — same standing
  decision as the colored `wisp_o/b/g` SIBLINGS (per-player-effect classes, never mirrored). **[V]**
- **Mirror keeps its ACTOR tick** (`DisableMovementTick`, CMC-only park): the wisp's ReceiveTick is
  per-viewer cosmetic design (fade gate, effect bob, shy-despawn on local approach/dawn, 1 Hz bad-camera
  scan is a BeginPlay latent either way). It spawns INVISIBLE; fade-in fires at the landing edge gated on
  **CMC `CurrentFloor.bBlockingHit`** — CMC-tick-computed, stale on a parked CMC — so the pose drive
  replays the edge (`ue_wrap::wisp::DriveWispLanding`: write `landed` + call `dir(true)`) when the
  streamed pose reads grounded. **[V smoke: resolve at +9 s = wisp #1's fall time]**
- **Destroy is an `EX_VirtualFunction` SELF-call** (timeline-reverse-finished → `K2_DestroyActor`; despawn
  check = local camera <100 m OR sun outside the night band, tick-driven, landed-gated) — the K2 PRE never
  sees it. Host pose walk catches the bound-but-dead actor → `SyncDestroyedNpcByEid` → `EntityDestroy`;
  the client mirror may also shy-despawn client-locally first (per-viewer SP design; the wire destroy then
  no-ops on "already not-live"). **[V smoke: 32/32 dead-retired at +6 s after forced midday, 32/32 client teardowns]**

### WorldActors (event actors)
- A **second** `BeginDeferred` interceptor with a **disjoint, NAME-matched** allowlist (17 leaf classes;
  name-match because event classes load lazily). FULL-rotation pose (`WorldActorPose`). Otherwise the NPC
  shape. **[V]**
- **2026-07-04 (piramid lane): two seams the interceptor shape alone missed, both closed generically:**
  (1) an EX_CallMath spawner (`piramidSpawner_C.runTrigger` — ALL its BeginDeferreds invisible to PE)
  is caught by `npc_world_enum`'s source-gated Func-thunk, whose drain feeds
  `world_actor_sync::HostEnrollExSpawn` (same end state as interceptor+POST; reverse-map dedup).
  (2) event-end SELF `K2_DestroyActor` never hits the destroy PRE observer → pose-walk **dead-retire**
  in `TickPoseStream` (bound-but-dead ⇒ retire + WorldActorDestroy broadcast) — this closed a latent
  mirror LEAK for every WA class, not just the pyramid. **[V: piramid e2e 2026-07-04 23:19]**
- `piramid2_C` additionally gets a choreography lane (`coop/creatures/piramid_sync`: client brain
  suppression + PyramidGather replay) — docs/events/piramid.md. **[AS-BUILT; walk at true scale V live
  2026-07-05; facing v100 pending 0s-FACING2]**
- **2026-07-05 (the frozen/small/wrong-facing pyramid arc — three wire truths, all classes):**
  (1) **v99 Scale3D in EntitySpawnPayload** (`419e3894`): the deferred-spawn FTransform CARRIES scale
  (piramid = 2.0) and a mirror spawned without it renders wrong-size + hovers at the wrong altitude
  (the host streams Z from ITS 10000*scaleX hover). All 6 EntitySpawn senders fill it (WA + NPC:
  interceptor / ex-enroll / connect-snapshot each); both receivers apply it into the spawn transform
  through `SanitizeWireScaleAxis` (scale-0 wire = invisible actor). **[V live: «пирамида идёт»]**
  (2) **v100 auxYaw in WorldActorPoseSnapshot** (`75e5ab10`): a class whose VISIBLE heading lives
  OUTSIDE the actor rotation (piramid: root yaw stays 0 forever — [WA-TRACE] live evidence; the
  AnimBP orients the body off the movementVector ArrowComponent) streams that heading as pose-batch
  auxYaw; the class lane consumes it post-apply (`piramid_sync::ApplyMirrorHeadingYaw` → BOTH heading
  components). Deriving it from position deltas was LIVE-REFUTED (native heading keeps easing toward
  the walk target up to 10 s after motion stops). **[AS-BUILT; 0s-FACING2 pending]**
  (3) **[WA-TRACE] permanent 1 Hz telemetry** (`c98c6543`) at all 5 pose hops incl. the
  K2_SetActorLocation/Rotation RETURN values — born because the "first batch" client log proved
  ARRIVAL only and the 07-04 e2e was geometry-blind (the wisp repin ring sat within the arrive radius
  of a FROZEN mirror too). The pose chain itself was then proven alive live (delta ~100 units).

### Kerfur (the hardest — prop form ⇄ NPC form)
- The game gives a kerfur NO stable id (random key per peer per load). We keep ONE host-only **KerfurId (K)**
  per logical kerfur spanning both forms; the rendered form is a normal `Npc` or `Prop` mirror at a per-form
  eid; K is preserved in place across conversions (`BindFormActor`, the SOLE `KerfurConvert` broadcaster).
  **[V]**
- Conversions are **INVISIBLE** (EX_CallMath) → caught by a **5 Hz death-watch poll** (element-present +
  bound-actor-dead == a local conversion), client-quiescence-gated. Client RELAYS the turn-on/off
  (`KerfurConvertRequest`); host runs the real verb authoritatively + broadcasts `KerfurConvert`; the client
  **claims-and-adopts** its conversion ghost (parks/freezes, never destroy+respawn). The historical dupe came
  from the mid-join turn-on window + the invisible spawn leaving untracked ghosts. **[V/RD]**
- **10:30 HANDS-ON (2026-06-29) — two roots still open [V (hands-on)]:** **(ROOT 1)** a steady-state turn-off
  DOUBLES on the client — `kerfur_convert.cpp:338` passes `deferKerfur=false` into the `fromConvert` arg slot,
  so the default `deferKerfur=true` survives → the convert's synthetic PropSpawn ARMS the join-window fuzzy
  adopter (`remote_prop_spawn.cpp:763`) → fresh-spawns a 2nd prop beside the orphaned local ghost (identical
  to the OBS-2 arg-slot bug already fixed at `kerfur_prop_adoption.cpp:178`). **(ROOT 2)** a mid-join
  `SendReliable(KerfurConvert)` can FAIL with no retry → 5-of-6 (kerfur FORM is not in the join snapshot, so
  nothing reconciles a dropped convert). Fix design (live-fix + the `coop/sync`-single-authority refactor that
  ends this whole dupe class):
  `research/findings/kerfur-identity-authority-and-module-refactor-DESIGN-2026-06-29.md`.

## NEEDS-PROBE (do not encode as truth without it)
- **[ANSWERED]** (trash redesign 08) PROBE-A: the carry slot is **`grabbing_actor`** (the PHC light-grab
  path, NOT `holding_actor`) — confirmed by the carry-churn finding + the autotest. (The old sub-question
  "which `OnPileGrabPre` early-return fires on a live CLIENT" is MOOT — the client-grab recognition is a
  camera-ray cone, NOT suppress-native; no `lookAtActor` read is involved.

- **[ANSWERED — YES (engage), 2026-06-22]** does `playerGrabbed(Player=puppet)` drive the grab on a PUPPET
  (host executes a client's grab intent)? **The grab ENGAGES + HOLDS on an unpossessed puppet**
  (`grabbing_actor := clump`, no `GetController`/PlayerController/possession dependency — RE + the runtime
  probe `VOTVCOOP_RUN_PUPPET_GRAB_PROBE`, commit `32ccd1bc`). **BUT the puppet's tick does NOT drive the
  per-tick PHC** (the clump floats at the spawn spot, `TRACKED=0`), so the host kinematically drives the
  held-clump pose (`coop/puppet_carry_drive`, `81e8e687`). Finding:
  `research/findings/votv-puppet-grab-feasibility-RE-2026-06-22.md`. This is the Increment-2 gate, now
  RESOLVED + the host-side BUILT [V harness].
- **[ANSWERED — NO, 2026-06-21]** does the `BeginDeferred`/`FinishSpawning` POST fire for the clump↔pile
  convert? **It does NOT** — the chipPile/clump caller issues it `EX_CallMath` (0 fires, 870 piles + every
  re-pile, commit `0e56ca39`). The deterministic catch is the **`UFunction::Func` thunk patch — now AS-BUILT**
  (`ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`, commit `d19ae4d4`; offsets pinned + read-only-validated).
- **[ANSWERED — RESOLVED, 2026-06-21]** the thunk-hook offsets on the shipping binary: `FFrame::Object`@0x18,
  `FFrame::Locals`@0x28, `UFunction::Func`@0xD8 — IDA-pinned + validated by the read-only log pass
  (`B7EEB1BF`); the spawned actor is read from `*Result` (not `Locals+returnOff`). Shipped in
  `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`. *(RETIRED morph [?]s removed: the "clump→holding_actor" link [it's grabbing_actor] + the land-claim/re-seed timing margin.)*
- **[?]** NPC/WorldActor client-suppression assumes spawner BPs null-check before `FinishSpawningActor`
  (UE4 convention; not IDA-confirmed on VOTV spawners).
- **[?]** WorldActor 16-name allowlist completeness / all-spawn-via-BeginDeferred — smoke-pending.

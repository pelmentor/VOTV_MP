# COOP — Entity Expression Map

## Identity ranges (all families)

`coop::element::Registry`: **HOST eids = `[1, kHostRangeSize=32768)`; CLIENT/peer eids = `[32768, …)`**.
`IsAllowedHostAllocatedEid` / `IsAllowedPeerAllocatedEid` are the trust gates; every wire receiver is
host-authoritative (`senderPeerSlot != 0` ⇒ drop, except the either-range cases — PropDestroy/PropConvert).
**[V]** (`kHostRangeSize` literal is in `coop/element/registry.h`).

## The families at a glance

## Per-family detail

### Keyed Aprop_C props
- **Spawn→catch:** save-loaded placed props are caught by the one-shot/throttled **GUObjectArray seed walk**
  (`SeedKnownKeyedProps`/`ReSeedKnownKeyedProps`), NOT the Init-POST observer **[V/RD]**; spawner-spawned
  props DO fire the **Init-POST observer** (`GrabObserver_Aprop_Init_POST_Body`) **[V]**; Q-menu/toolgun
  BeginDeferred spawns are caught at **`FinishSpawningActor` POST** (their `init()` is BP-internal →
  Init-POST never fires) **[V]**; container `takeObj` is caught at **takeObj POST** (the nested Init defers
  via `g_takeObjInFlight`) **[V]**.
- **Identity:** the **BP save Key string** is the cross-peer id (the game mints it via `NewGuid`; we READ it,
  and on a receiver write the host's Key via `setKey` before FinishSpawningActor) **[V/RD]**; a host eid
  rides alongside.
- **Client never authors a save-loaded Aprop_C** (`prop_lifecycle.cpp:193` `IsDescendantOfProp → return`) —
  host-authoritative. **[V]** Two INTENT doors route around it, host as the sole author: the F2
  **PropDropIntent** (a parked-key pocket→place, v106) and — v114 (L7, `ba8ce297`) — **ReelEjectIntent**
  (a client caddy/reelbox EJECT births a reel in-hand; the unparked reel-class client FinishSpawn in the
  F2 drain sends the intent; the host `HostSpawnPlacedProp`s it born-ASLEEP, class-whitelisted to the
  `Aprop_reel_C` lineage — NOT a general client-spawn door) **[AS-BUILT, smoke]**.
- **Save-scalar at birth (v114):** per-prop save state (`struct_save.mFloat[0]`-class — the reel's
  `Progress @0x364`) rides `PropSpawnPayload.savedScalar` (+flag 0x40) on EVERY birth path — live express,
  join snapshot, container extract, BOTH intent kinds — via ONE shared reader
  (`prop::ReadSavedScalarForClass`); ONE mirror-birth apply. Missing ANY path = a CDO-default mirror whose
  value a peer re-broadcasts as truth (the correctness-audit CRITICAL of the L7 build). **[AS-BUILT]**
- **Destroy:** engine `K2_DestroyActor` **PRE** → `PropDestroy(key,eid)` **[V]**; BP-internal vanishes
  (truck/cull/LifeSpan, EX_CallMath) → the host **reaper death-watch** (`ReapDeadLocalPropElements` →
  explicit `PropDestroy(eid)`, kerfur-skipped) **[V]**.
- **The floppy disc across the laptop slot (v116 `613f2ac4`):** insert = `floppyIn.K2_DestroyActor`
  (uber@7404) — the disc DIES into laptop scalars; that destroy rides the generic seam above (ONE
  owner — the planned lane-side eid capture was dropped once `prop_destroy_seam.cpp` proved to cover
  both roles). Eject = fresh `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`+`FinishSpawningActor` (uber@8593/8717)
  with `loadData` restore — the spawn rides the SAME birth channels as the reel (host watcher / the F2
  drain); the disc's CONTENT (strings — too big for `savedScalar`) rides the `LaptopState` DiscContent
  side-channel under HOST authority, correlated to a client-eject birth via the adoption eid-binding.
  A held disc's world identity died at pickup (hand-actor keyless+eidless = correctly seam-dropped).
  **[AS-BUILT v116, smoke; RE votv-laptop-pc-RE-2026-07-17.md FD-Q1]**
- **The desk module prop across the physMods sockets (v118 `45a886a4`):** plug =
  `K2_DestroyActor(holdActor)` inside `plugInModule` (in-hand, NO prior release — the native path
  itself destroys held actors) — rides the generic seam above, both roles (a client-held module's
  host twin already died at grab, so receivers no-op). Unplug = `lib.physModToActor(byte)` →
  BeginDeferred+Finish → `player."Hold Object"` (born INTO THE HAND): on the HOST the spawn watcher
  expresses it the same tick (the hand exclusion is only the hotbar view husk) and it rides normal
  carry; on a CLIENT it is invisible-while-held (doctrine) and births at DROP via the kind-104
  fresh-birth whitelist widened to `IsChildOf(Aprop_physModule_C)` (the byte rides the CLASS — no
  scalar channel). The ARRAY state itself is the `PhysModsState` lane (value-ops + host-canonical);
  a raced unplug's ghost is deny-swept, a raced dup-plug is host-REFUNDED (a fresh spawn at the
  desk). **[AS-BUILT v118, smoke + join-canonical in-log; design votv-physmods-L8-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md]**
- **Connect reconcile:** R2 blob-vs-live key-diff deletes → SnapshotBegin/claim-tracking → bracketed
  PropSpawn stream → SnapshotComplete → quiescence-gated **divergence sweep** (membership = the client's
  own local Prop Elements, mirror-excluded; **>50% world-wipe valve**) → `EnsurePileBindIndex` position-bind
  for keyless piles (retires the client-local identity). **[V]**
- **JOIN BARRIER (2026-07-12 `bbf91f39` [V — take-6 hands-on 2026-07-12 13:21: user-verified the
  in-window placed rock present on the client; log-verified: client QUIESCED 13:20:38 STRICTLY before

  post-arm, bind 872/872, 0 errors both peers] — SUPERSEDES the
  takes-1-4 join-window PROVISIONALITY machinery, RULE 2):** `ClientWorldReady` is announced at
  **load-tail QUIESCENCE** (the `coop/session/world_load_episode` probe latch — the same
  population-stability gate the doom sweep always trusted, now the ONE owner of the "is my world
  settled" axis), not at "world up + registry coherent". The host streams the entire connect replay
  (R2 deletes → snapshot → state lanes → teleport) only after the announce, so **no wire prop
  expression can arrive while loadObjects' churn runs** — nothing is ever provisional, and the
  reliable channel's in-lane FIFO is the only ordering authority (the MTA INITIAL_DATA_STREAM
  shape, CGame.cpp:1393). Retired with it: the in-episode spawn capture + revalidation drain
  (takes 1-2), the wire-order queue netting (take 4), the SnapshotBegin-lost watchdog
  quiescence-by-ceiling (the probe is wire-independent; the lost-bracket flake is a 30 s
  post-announce timeout in the sweep). KEPT: the outbound destroy-broadcast suppression episode
  (host-wipe fix; now self-closing at the probe latch), deferred destroys (travel window +
  probe-deadline DEGRADED mode), b3 pos-corrections, twins/ghost/kerfur retires (save-vs-wire
  STATE reconcile), the doom sweep (claims → doom judges last, take-3 order preserved), the fuzzy
  rekey-steal denial (`ResolveMirrorEidByActor(wireMirrorOnly)`), the dead-row TRIPWIRE + per-doom
  cls/key/loc logs. Design doc:
  `research/findings/join-identity/votv-join-barrier-DESIGN-2026-07-12.md`; the six-root saga RCA:
  `research/findings/join-identity/votv-join-window-placed-prop-RCA-2026-07-11.md`.

  form was 162x inert on the same save); UNCHANGED by the join barrier — the key-dedup axis is
  orthogonal to ordering — the `2fefd161` form was INERT: 162x "setKey not found
  on trashBitsPile_C", the family is actor_save_C lineage with setKey declared on the ANCESTOR and
  FindFunction is exact-owner; `460da7e4` = `R::SuperStructOf` + a SuperStruct-CLIMBING
  `ResolveSetKeyFn`, the Aprop_C hardcoded fallback removed]):** VOTV's own save data ships DUPLICATE
  interactable Keys — the live host save carried 85
  `trashBitsPile_C` across FOUR keys (65+12+5+3 save-born clone families; the 2026-06-24 sweep was
  already silently dooming "80 trashBitsPile" — same phenomenon, unnoticed). Every identity layer (key
  index, exact-key converge, keyed churn RE-BIND, R2 key-diff) assumes Key uniqueness; a clone family
  funnels all its wire rows onto ONE actor, the leftovers die at churn, and the revalidation drain then
  re-expresses them INTO already-occupied positions (→ interpenetrating awake physics = the take-3 fps
  storm). Fix: the HOST is the key authority (MTA shape — the server owns element-ID uniqueness). At
  enroll, inside `MarkPropElement` (the ONE enrollment owner — covers the census walk AND the Init-POST
  late-load catch; a census-only detector was an audit HIGH), a keyed actor whose Key is already carried
  by a DIFFERENT live actor is re-keyed with a fresh `rk_<64-bit-random-hex>` key
  (`prop_synth_key::MintFreshKeyForDuplicate`; GT-gated — setKey is a PE dispatch). A DEAD incumbent =
  churn recreate INHERITING its identity (spared by `FindLiveActorByKey` liveness). The game re-saves
  live keys per actor → the fix bakes into the host save + every transferred client world.
  `MarkPropElement` returns the enrolled key; broadcast callers build their payload key from the return.
  CLIENT/SP never re-key. First-enrollment-only (one-way door — documented at the idempotency early-out).

**Durable facts (survive the redesign):**
- **chipPile is KEYLESS** — `setKey` is a no-op; the only identity is the host-minted eid. **[V/RD]**
  Caught by the seed-walk keyless-pile lane (`IsChipPile`) → connect snapshot / R1 re-seed. **[V]**
- **IDENTITY MECHANISM UPDATE (2026-06-27/28, sync-consolidation refactor) [RD]:** Prop identity is now ONE
  owner end-to-end — `element::Registry` (the unified `actor→eid` reverse `EidForActor`) + the
  `coop::element::CreateOrAdoptPropMirror` bind keystone. THREE leaked satellites are now DELETED:
  `g_propElementsById` (earlier), `g_boundMirrorNatives` (the is-save-native SET → now `Element::IsSaveNative`,
  `066d0a49`), and `g_actorToPropElementId` (the locals-only actor→eid map → now `EidForActor`, `6aeaf55c`;
  `GetPropElementIdForActor` re-imposes the locals-only contract with an `IsMirror` filter, and idempotency is
  now safer — it also blocks minting a local over a live mirror, a dup the old map couldn't see).
  `RegisterPropMirror` is now a thin forwarder to `CreateOrAdoptPropMirror` (`ecdc527c`). (2) "is this actor a
  bound save-loaded native" (`IsBoundMirrorNative`) resolves `actor→eid` via `EidForActor` → `IsSaveNative()` +
  liveness — atomic with the binding, can never read stale (was the 15:01:49 D1 root). (3) The join reconcile
  (twin-retire / variant-1 / b3 / deferred-destroy / kerfur-retire) is NO LONGER a join-window one-shot: it is the ONE
  order owner `coop/element/quiescence_drain::RunReconcile` (was `identity_reconcile::RunIdentityReconcile`, consolidated
  2026-06-30), driven by the join sweep AND a steady trigger (`OnTick`: pending-twin/b3/destroy/kerfur work OR a 6s
  post-purge window) AND the >50% valve-ABORT path.
  Commits `ce132e0d`/`066d0a49`/`47384057`/`432183ce`/`8b85cb2e`/`ecdc527c`/`6aeaf55c`. **VERIFIED real log
  16:06 2026-06-28: fix #1 (valve-abort reconcile, 242 RE-BIND) + fix #2 (post-purge window, 13 fires) BOTH
  fired, world clean.** Keystone (CreateOrAdopt + satellite retires) build GREEN. NOT-yet-hands-on: D1
  grab-no-dup, D2 kerfur-no-flash (the interaction scenarios). See [[project-sync-module-refactor-2026-06-27]].
- **VERIFIED mechanic (bytecode):** `actorChipPile_C` = CARRY-AND-THROW (E → `playerGrabbed` spawns a
  clump in hand + destroys the pile; the clump re-piles on its **2nd ground contact** at the clump's
  **sphere-traced RESTING point** — NOT `lastPos`, NOT the source pile pos → why proximity was doomed).
  `trashBitsPile_C` = a SEPARATE COLLECT entity (keyed-Aprop lane). Only `chipType@0x0238` (cosmetic
  variant) carries. **[V/RD]**
- **OBSERVABILITY (corrected 2026-06-21):** `playerGrabbed`/`pickupObjectDirect`/`K2_DestroyActor(self)` are
  INVISIBLE (`EX_LocalVirtualFunction`). **The clump-spawn (grab) + the pile-respawn (re-pile) are ALSO
  INVISIBLE** — the chipPile/clump ubergraphs issue `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`/`FinishSpawningActor`
  as **`EX_CallMath`** (a native thunk below ProcessEvent). `host_spawn_watcher` catches that UFunction only
  from the NATIVE/SPAWNER caller (pinecone/`garbagePileSpawner`); for the BP-ubergraph caller it logged **0
  fires** (870 piles + every re-pile, hands-on 2026-06-21, commit `0e56ca39`). **Visibility is the CALLER's
  opcode, not the callee.** The 2026-06-08 `pass2` RE had this RIGHT; the s35 "BeginDeferred observable"
  reversal was the regression. `WorldContextObject == EX_Self` (the source) is bytecode-confirmed for both
  transitions; it is READ via a `UFunction::Func` thunk patch (AS-BUILT, `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`, commit
  `d19ae4d4` — the thunk reads `FFrame::Object`@0x18 = `EX_Self`), NOT a ProcessEvent observer.

**The design (08, host-authoritative state machine):** the eid is a host-minted life-stable logical trash
entity (state PILED/HELD_BY(N)/FLYING; **position is NEVER identity for the GRAB** → the cluster mis-bind is
impossible by construction). Host owns the authoritative state; receivers drive a local visual from it.
Client-grab = **camera-ray cone recognition + `GrabIntent` → host executes the real verb on puppet-N + a
host-AUTH per-eid carry pose stream + `ThrowIntent`** (the FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness], proto v85,
HEAD `29353191`; see the Increment-2 bullet below). A sync-time-context byte rejects stale packets.
- **GRAB (pile→clump) — [V] VERIFIED hands-on (`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`), proto v82, commit `0e56ca39`:**
  `trash_collect_sync::OnPileGrabPre` (the `InpActEvt_use` PRE — a real input event, ProcessEvent-VISIBLE)
  records the aimed pile's eid (`trash_channel::NotePendingGrab`); `local_streams`' held-edge adopts the
  spawned clump onto E (`AdoptPendingGrabClump → trash_channel::OnHostConvert(kToClump)`). Identity is the
  host eid end-to-end; NO proximity.
- **RE-PILE (clump→pile) — [AS-BUILT], the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter (commit
  `d19ae4d4`):** a transparent forwarder patched onto `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`'s `Func`
  (`UFunction+0xD8`, via `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`) fires on the clump's `EX_CallMath` re-pile spawn →
  `OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve` reads `FFrame::Object`(@0x18 = source clump = `EX_Self`) + `*Result`(= new
  pile); a TRACKED clump → `OnHostConvert(kToPile)` converts E onto the EXACT spawned pile the SAME tick →
  the client re-skins its ONE mirror (no destroy+spawn dupe). **Zero proximity, no reaper race.** Detection
  VERIFIED hands-on (read-only `B7EEB1BF`: thunk `*Result` ptr-for-ptr == the old death-watch's pile); the
  CONVERT flip is now VERIFIED [V hands-on take-30] (re-pile + rotation correct at the land-settle COMMIT). The
  proximity death-watch (`WatchClumpForRepile` /
  `FindNearestUntrackedChipPile_`) is RETIRED (RULE 2). **Former known-minor [RESOLVED]:** the ~5s
  vanish-return (reaper-vs-rebind) is gone by construction (the convert lands the new pile under E the same
  tick the clump dies). RE: `research/findings/piles-trash/votv-chippile-dispatch-and-thunk-hook-RE-2026-06-21.md` §3/§6.
- **GRAB-via-thunk + the eid=0 adopt-miss close — [DESIGN], NOT built:** move the grab (pile→clump) to the
  same thunk (srcObj = tracked chipPile → kToClump), retiring the InpActEvt-PRE + held-edge adopt and
  catching the grab even when the PRE missed (an UNTRACKED clump currently skips the converter). A tightening.
- **Increment 2 (CLIENT-grab direction) — the FULL CHAIN, AS-BUILT + [V harness]. proto v85, HEAD
  `29353191`, deployed `BB94A120A969A51E` (push held).** A client AIMS at a mirrored pile, GRABS, CARRIES,
  THROWS, it re-piles — all verified (0 CRITICAL fail) via the REAL E-press path.
  - **Recognition = a CAMERA-RAY CONE** (`trash_proxy::EidForAimedPileProxy`) in `OnPileGrabPre` — picks the
    most-centered pile proxy on the view-camera forward. The "suppress-native + read `lookAtActor`/
    `lookatActorCurrent`" plan + the proxy QueryOnly collision are **RETIRED (RULE 2)**: a bare AStaticMeshActor
    proxy can NEVER be `lookAtActor` (the `int_player_C` filter at LookAtFunction @3250) AND the worn pile mesh
    has no simple collision body (harness `trace-gate hit=0`). No suppress-native needed (the proxy fails the
    native cast on its own). E-press TOGGLES grab vs throw via the client carry-state.
    `[[lesson-proxy-never-lookatactor-use-camera-cone]]`
  - **Carry visibility = a NEW host-authoritative per-eid pose stream** (`MsgType::TrashCarryPose=34`,
    `TrashClumpPoseSnapshot` 32B, the `StoreRemoteWorldActorBatch` pattern). A client only drives pose slot 0
    + the relay never echoes to the origin, so the host-driven puppet-held clump's pose MUST be host-
    originated; every client drives the proxy via a per-eid `ActiveDrive` interp (`coop/trash_clump_pose_stream`,
    `coop/puppet_carry_drive::Tick` publishes carry + flight). Scales to N simultaneous client grabs.
  - **Throw** = `OnThrowIntent` releases the puppet grab (the re-pile gate reads not-held) + applies physics
    velocity along the puppet aim → the clump flies (flight stream) + self-re-piles via its own ground-hit
    thunk → ToPile. `ThrowIntentPayload` is eid-only (the host derives the direction).
  - **Abort (audit HIGH fix)** = a clump lost mid-carry → `ReleaseClientHold` broadcasts `PropDestroy(eid)`
    so clients retire the frozen proxy + `ClearClientCarry` (else the client was stuck in throw-mode forever).
  - The interp was EXTRACTED to `coop/active_drive.h` (remote_prop 1375→1222, RULE 2026-05-25; carry
    regression confirms zero behaviour change). Finding:
    `research/findings/physics-grab/votv-increment2-clientgrab-FULL-CHAIN-AS-BUILT-2026-06-23.md`. **NEXT (greenlight):**
    a `garbageCollider`-analog SHAPE component on the proxy for occlusion-correct aim + movement-block (the
    cone ignores walls; the proxy is still walk-through).
- **CLIENT MIRROR of trash = a host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` PROXY — DUP-FIX (derived) + VISIBILITY +
  CARRY-FREEZE + carry-JANK + THROW-ARC + ROTATION + SOUND all [V hands-on] VERIFIED; Z-fix + LEVEL-PILE
  dup-DESTROY + FPS-fix [V harness]; proxy SCALE AS-BUILT. HEAD `a5282f57`, deployed `015F0AC9590B6B23`,
  proto v83:** the client's mirror of a chipPile/clump is NO LONGER the real self-morphing BP — it is an
  `AStaticMeshActor` WE own (`coop/trash_proxy`): NO blueprint (never self-morphs), `AddToRoot` (never GC'd →
  never stale-index), our eid→actor registry (`g_proxies`), re-skin (`SetStaticMesh`) IN PLACE on convert
  (never spawn-fresh). **Spawn** = `trash_proxy::SpawnProxy` (caught at the `OnSpawn` trash-class branch,
  BEFORE the BP dedup); **identity** = the eid in `g_proxies` + the Prop mirror (`RegisterPropMirror`);
  **re-skin** = `OnConvert` → `IsProxy(E)` → `ReskinProxy`; **destroy** = `OnDestroy`/disconnect →
  `RetireProxy` (`DestroyActor → RemoveFromRoot → unbind`). The proxy's `UStaticMeshComponent` is set
  **Movable** (`SetComponentMobility`, `245148c6`) because a runtime `AStaticMeshActor` defaults to STATIC, on
  which `SetStaticMesh`/`SetActorLocation` silently no-op. This **closed the former OPEN client
  mirror-staleness dup** (a real-BP join-mirror went NOT-LIVE within ~10s → `ResolveLiveActorByEid` null →
  fresh-clump spawn + the original lingering = the dup) — now impossible BY CONSTRUCTION (the 3-verdict
  discriminator / health-poll / serial-check plan is DROPPED as moot); the dup-gone + the resting/landed-pile
  mirror are **hands-on confirmed [V]**. **The LIVE CARRY-FREEZE is [V] FIXED hands-on** via the **`!carrying`
  release-edge gate** in `local_streams.cpp` (`else if (g_lastHeldProp &&
  !coop::trash_channel::IsCarrying(g_lastHeldEid))`) — the client clump UPDATES through the carry now (no freeze
  between E-events). The earlier "carry MIRRORS on a settled join / the failure was the JOIN RACE" claim was
  **WITHDRAWN as FALSE**; the actual release-edge cause was **`updateHold` PUPPET RECREATION** (the `heldActor`
  ptr changes with `pendingSettle=0`), NOT a contact-re-pile churn — which is why the `carrying &&
  HasPendingSettle` gate (`C9F28176`/commit `16ac153f`) FAILED and suppressing the WHOLE carry (`!carrying`) is
  the fix. **Host carries FINE** (native); **OTHER props mirror fine** (pose-stream). **NOW FIXED/BUILT this
  session:** (1) carry **JANK — FIXED [V hands-on]** (shipped `df158728`): the `key.len=4`→keyless theory was DISPROVEN
  by bytecode (BP `GetKey` returns the FName `"None"` for BOTH `prop_garbageClump_C` and `actorChipPile_C`, so
  `key.len=4` is the literal string "None"; the receiver already guards `keyW != "None"`→eid at
  `remote_prop.cpp:403`, so forcing keyless was a no-op). REAL root (code-proven): an interpolation
  PHASE-STALL — `BeginLerpToPose` set `lerpStartMs=nowMs`, `AdvanceLerp` sampled the same `nowMs` → alpha=0
  every new-pose tick at vsync-60. FIX = fixed-delay snapshot interpolation (`remote_prop.cpp` ActiveDrive
  buffers 2 timestamped poses prevLoc/lastLoc + prevPoseMs/lastPoseMs; renders `nowMs-span` behind; alpha by
  real timestamps; MTA `CClientVehicle` shape). User hands-on: carry now SMOOTH like a normal object. (2) proxy
  **SCALE — AS-BUILT** (shipped `df158728`, proto v82→v83; the COMMIT re-reads `GetActorScale3D`): the prior
  "`PropConvertPayload` has `scaleX/Y/Z` @protocol.h:2208" was WRONG (that was `PropSpawnPayload`); added
  `scaleX/Y/Z` to `PropConvertPayload` (static_assert 100→112), `BroadcastConvert` sends per-form
  `GetActorScale3D(newActor)`, new `ue_wrap::engine::SetActorScale3D`, the proxy applies it via `ApplyProxyScale`
  (guarded >0.001) in `SpawnProxy`+`ReskinProxy`; not separately eyeballed (covered by the commit re-read).
  (2b) pile-landing **ROTATION + throw SOUND — FIXED [V hands-on take-30]:** rot is re-read from the SETTLED
  pile at the land-settle COMMIT (`trash_channel.cpp:248`; the thunk passes the clump as a fallback
  `trash_collect_sync.cpp:91`); the pickup-cue-on-throw is killed (the flight branch streams the carry key
  without a re-StartDrive + a trash eid sends NO PropRelease; `OnHostRelease` RETIRED, RULE 2). (2c) the
  **Z/HEIGHT regression arc — FIXED [V harness]:** take-31 read the pile transform from `newActor` at the
  BeginDeferred POST = `(0,0,0)` (pile unpositioned pre-FinishSpawning) → derived piles snapped to world origin;
  the take-32 FIX re-reads the pile's REAL transform at the land-settle COMMIT (`trash_channel.cpp:248-256`),
  harness client-render-matches-host drift=0cm; the native-destroy was INNOCENT (harness-confirmed), the bug was
  the `(0,0,0)` loc. (3) **ORPHAN dup — SPLIT by pile origin; the DESTROY is now BUILT + VERIFIED [V harness].**
  DERIVED (gameplay-born) piles: dup GONE [V hands-on] (born only as a host convert → a proxy on both sides, no
  native twin). ORIGINAL (level-placed) piles: the client's NATIVE level-loaded chipPile coexisted with the
  host proxy (root CONFIRMED: level-piles get an eid+proxy via the eidOnly lane; the divergence sweep is BLIND
  to natives) — now `remote_prop_spawn.cpp:387-410` DESTROYS the co-located native at a pile proxy-spawn (exact
  ~1cm + chipType + IsLiveByIndex; exact-or-skip on >1; graceful on 0 matches; GATED on `g_claimTrackingActive`
  = the join bracket only; harness dup-destroy-clean 12 twins / 0 SKIP). NOT adopt (adopt re-introduces the BP
  self-morph the proxy avoids). The read-only PILE-PROBE that confirmed coexistence is REPLACED by this destroy
  (RULE 2, retired). (Supersedes the prior "eid-resolve race / `isProxy=0` spawn-fresh" theory — it was native
  coexistence.) (3b) **FPS — the ~4s stutter FIXED [V harness]:** `net_pump.cpp:559` guards the steady-world
  re-seed on the GUObjectArray high-water mark (NumObjects) + a ~20s safety census, so the ~237k-object walk is
  SKIPPED at rest; harness fps-reseed-rate 0.073/s (was ~0.25/s every 4s). (4) **the `simulateDrop`
  throw-velocity FLIP is DEAD — REPLACED by carry/flight stream-continuity; the THROW ARC is VERIFIED [V
  hands-on take-29 + harness]** (shipped `136ed779`): both the `simulateDrop` thunk AND its successor
  `dropGrabObject` thunk fired ZERO times across 7 grab/release cycles (the clump release uses NEITHER verb —
  the clump rides `grabbing_actor`, the PHC handle, not `holding_actor`) though the same Func-thunk facility
  fired all run; verb-detection ABANDONED. PIVOT: the throw needs no verb/velocity — the host's thrown clump
  really flies (physics) until it re-piles, so `local_streams.cpp`'s release-edge `!carrying`-SKIP branch now
  CONTINUES streaming `g_lastHeldProp`'s pose under the same eid E while it is a LIVE garbageClump (`IsLive` is
  the churn/flight discriminator — a churn re-pile kills the clump → skip; a real release leaves it flying →
  stream); the client's fixed-delay interp shows the arc; it ends when the clump re-piles (ToPile
  re-skins+snaps). The arc FLIES (user: "дуга ЛЕТИТ"; the autotest now does a real DIRECTIONAL throw). The dead
  `dropGrabObject` read-only thunk was RETIRED 2026-07-10 `fb490e36` (RULE 2; retirement notes left

  **Dead ends:** **Option 1** (`8bc797ef`,
  `SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false)` on the held clump) BUILT + FAILED — the live host BP re-arms hit-notify.
  **Option 2 (DISPROVEN by bytecode, NOT pending):** the `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate is DEAD — `holdPlayer`
  (`@0x0240 AmainPlayer_C*`, CXXHeaderDump-confirmed) is set ONCE on grab (`actorChipPile.json` @8492) and
  NEVER cleared in any BP, so it cannot mark "released." (CLOSE-B latch + land-settle SHIPPED `65AD883A` —
  correct, not the freeze cause.) **Phase 1 = visual + position + re-skin, EXPLICIT NoCollision**; collision
  (the `garbageCollider` hull) is PHASE 2 with Increment 2. Design + AS-BUILT:
  `research/findings/piles-trash/votv-pile-mirror-staleness-robustness-DESIGN-2026-06-21.md`; the carry root + fix (the

  harness: `[[reference-pile-test-harness]]`. **STILL OPEN (NEXT):** a `garbageCollider`-analog SHAPE component
  on the proxy (occlusion-correct aim + movement-block — the client-grab camera cone ignores walls, the proxy
  is walk-through); the WHOOSH throw sound (no ReliableKind; user-deprioritized, best confirmed by hearing);
  the `event_dispatch_trash.cpp` extraction. (The dead `dropGrabObject` thunk: RETIRED 2026-07-10 `fb490e36`.)

### NPCs / Characters
- Host `BeginDeferred` **interceptor** (allowlist of 15 ACharacter bases) allocs an `Npc` Element + POST
  binds the actor; **client suppresses its own** local spawn (zero ReturnValue + return true) and
  materializes from the wire (`OnEntitySpawn`). Save-loaded twins (`savePersisted=1`) → **deferred adoption**
  by class+nearest-pose (never by key — the key is random per peer). Pose via `EntityPose` batch (>31
  tracked → fair-share rotation at the publisher, the MTA far-sync shape). Destroy
  via `K2_DestroyActor` PRE → `EntityDestroy`; a bound actor found dead in the pose walk (PE-invisible
  self-destroy) → `SyncDestroyedNpcByEid` retire + `EntityDestroy` (2026-07-03). **[V]**

### wisp_C (the wispSwarm-event swarm — the EX_CallMath NPC; 2026-07-03, smoke 32/32×4 legs)
- **Spawn dispatch is `EX_CallMath` BeginDeferred** from `trigger_wispSwarm_2`'s ubergraph (up to 32, one
  per 0.25–1.0 s, annulus 500–750 m out / 500 m up) — the PE interceptor+POST NEVER fire. Caught by the
  **`ufunction_hook` Func-thunk** on the same UFunction (chains after trash_collect's), **SOURCE-GATED by
  `FFrame::Object`'s class == `trigger_wispSwarm_C`**, queued (fires PRE-Finish, transform unset), enrolled
  at the next pose tick (`npc_world_enum::DrainPendingExSpawns` → the shared `EnrollUntrackedNpcActor`). **[V smoke]**
- **AMBIENT sky wisps: REVERSED to host-auth 2026-07-10 eve** (`08560687`). The old "per-peer by design"
  call assumed player-anchoring; the bytecode dump shows ABSOLUTE map coords (+-60-70k X/Y, Z=80k) ->
  world-anchored. Now: `ticker_wispSpawner_C` IS an EX-catch source row, the 8 color variants
  (`wisp_b/red/bl/w/g/o/p/blu_C` -- direct ACharacter subclasses, NOT wisp_C children) are allowlisted
  (15->23), and the client's ticker tick is cancelled (spawn_authority t3). **[AS-BUILT; smoke: 23/23
  resolve both peers]**
- **Mirror keeps its ACTOR tick** (`DisableMovementTick`, CMC-only park): the wisp's ReceiveTick is
  per-viewer cosmetic design (fade gate, effect bob, shy-despawn on local approach/dawn, 1 Hz bad-camera
  scan is a BeginPlay latent either way). It spawns INVISIBLE; fade-in fires at the landing edge gated on
  **CMC `CurrentFloor.bBlockingHit`** — CMC-tick-computed, stale on a parked CMC — so the pose drive
  replays the edge (`ue_wrap::wisp::DriveWispLanding`: write `landed` + call `dir(true)`) when the
  streamed pose reads grounded. **[V smoke: resolve at +9 s = wisp #1's fall time]**
- **Destroy is an `EX_VirtualFunction` SELF-call** (timeline-reverse-finished → `K2_DestroyActor`; despawn
  check = local camera <100 m OR sun outside the night band, tick-driven, landed-gated) — the K2 PRE never
  sees it. Host pose walk catches the bound-but-dead actor → `SyncDestroyedNpcByEid` → `EntityDestroy`;
  the client mirror may also shy-despawn client-locally first (per-viewer SP design; the wire destroy then
  no-ops on "already not-live"). **[V smoke: 32/32 dead-retired at +6 s after forced midday, 32/32 client teardowns]**

### WorldActors (event actors)
- A **second** `BeginDeferred` interceptor with a **disjoint, NAME-matched** allowlist (17 leaf classes;
  name-match because event classes load lazily). FULL-rotation pose (`WorldActorPose`). Otherwise the NPC
  shape. **[V]**
- **2026-07-04 (piramid lane): two seams the interceptor shape alone missed, both closed generically:**
  (1) an EX_CallMath spawner (`piramidSpawner_C.runTrigger` — ALL its BeginDeferreds invisible to PE)
  is caught by `npc_world_enum`'s source-gated Func-thunk, whose drain feeds
  `world_actor_sync::HostEnrollExSpawn` (same end state as interceptor+POST; reverse-map dedup).
  (2) event-end SELF `K2_DestroyActor` never hits the destroy PRE observer → pose-walk **dead-retire**
  in `TickPoseStream` (bound-but-dead ⇒ retire + WorldActorDestroy broadcast) — this closed a latent
  mirror LEAK for every WA class, not just the pyramid. **[V: piramid e2e 2026-07-04 23:19]**
- `piramid2_C` additionally gets a choreography lane (`coop/creatures/piramid_sync`: client brain
  suppression + PyramidGather replay) — docs/events/piramid.md. **[AS-BUILT; walk at true scale V live
  2026-07-05; facing v100 pending 0s-FACING2]**
- **2026-07-05 (the frozen/small/wrong-facing pyramid arc — three wire truths, all classes):**
  (1) **v99 Scale3D in EntitySpawnPayload** (`419e3894`): the deferred-spawn FTransform CARRIES scale
  (piramid = 2.0) and a mirror spawned without it renders wrong-size + hovers at the wrong altitude
  (the host streams Z from ITS 10000*scaleX hover). All 6 EntitySpawn senders fill it (WA + NPC:
  interceptor / ex-enroll / connect-snapshot each); both receivers apply it into the spawn transform
  through `SanitizeWireScaleAxis` (scale-0 wire = invisible actor). **[V live: «пирамида идёт»]**
  (2) **v100 auxYaw in WorldActorPoseSnapshot** (`75e5ab10`): a class whose VISIBLE heading lives
  OUTSIDE the actor rotation (piramid: root yaw stays 0 forever — [WA-TRACE] live evidence; the
  AnimBP orients the body off the movementVector ArrowComponent) streams that heading as pose-batch
  auxYaw; the class lane consumes it post-apply (`piramid_sync::ApplyMirrorHeadingYaw` → BOTH heading
  components). Deriving it from position deltas was LIVE-REFUTED (native heading keeps easing toward
  the walk target up to 10 s after motion stops). **[AS-BUILT; 0s-FACING2 pending]**
  (3) **[WA-TRACE] permanent 1 Hz telemetry** (`c98c6543`) at all 5 pose hops incl. the
  K2_SetActorLocation/Rotation RETURN values — born because the "first batch" client log proved
  ARRIVAL only and the 07-04 e2e was geometry-blind (the wisp repin ring sat within the arrive radius
  of a FROZEN mirror too). The pose chain itself was then proven alive live (delta ~100 units).

### Kerfur (the hardest — prop form ⇄ NPC form)
- The game gives a kerfur NO stable id (random key per peer per load). We keep ONE host-only **KerfurId (K)**
  per logical kerfur spanning both forms; the rendered form is a normal `Npc` or `Prop` mirror at a per-form
  eid; K is preserved in place across conversions (`BindFormActor`, the SOLE `KerfurConvert` broadcaster).
  **[V]**
- Conversions are **INVISIBLE** (EX_CallMath) → caught by a **5 Hz death-watch poll** (element-present +
  bound-actor-dead == a local conversion), client-quiescence-gated. Client RELAYS the turn-on/off
  (`KerfurConvertRequest`); host runs the real verb authoritatively + broadcasts `KerfurConvert`; the client
  **claims-and-adopts** its conversion ghost (parks/freezes, never destroy+respawn). The historical dupe came
  from the mid-join turn-on window + the invisible spawn leaving untracked ghosts. **[V/RD]**
- **The 2026-06-29 "two roots" are BOTH CLOSED [status verified against code 2026-07-12]:** ROOT 1
  (the `fromConvert`/`deferKerfur` arg-slot swap) fixed at `kerfur_convert.cpp:332-344` (explicit
  `fromConvert=false, deferKerfur=false` with the ROOT-1 comment); ROOT 2 (mid-join KerfurConvert
  drop) closed by v91 (`retireOffEid` rides the npc EntitySpawn, which the connect snapshot always
  delivers) + the 2026-07-12 JOIN BARRIER (no mid-churn window). Historical design doc:
  `research/findings/kerfur/kerfur-identity-authority-and-module-refactor-DESIGN-2026-06-29.md`.
- **TAKE-9/10 AFTERMATH + THE VM PLAN (2026-07-13):** take-9 exposed the turn-ON twin pair (client
  destroy-seam relayed a kerfur-mirror death → host killed its authoritative prop → «kerfur deleted
  everywhere»; host-own turn-on had structurally NO converge — this same destroy seam drains the prop
  element synchronously with the death, so the poll's premise never holds for a host prop). The take-10
  fix (`873ce32a`: destroy-edge capture + fresh-spawn stamps + eid-first OnDestroy) REGRESSED: the
  capture NEVER fired — the destroy seam is a **POST** hook, `GetActorLocation` on the already-destroyed
  actor reads (0,0,0) and the 5 m filter silently declined every candidate (both silent exits had no
  logging). eid-first OnDestroy (kept — correct fix) flipped the visible symptom from "stale off-prop"
  to "dies on the other peer". **Resolution: /qf 15 design pass (13 rounds, converged) →
  `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md`** — VM verb brackets + the form-flip assembler replace the whole
  compensation family; the key reframing: the conversion verbs are `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` (VM-
  hookable via GNatives swap) and their INNER spawns are EX_CallMath→Func-VISIBLE (the "wall" was only
  ever EX_Local*→script). [[lesson-post-destroy-seam-reads-zeros-and-silent-declines]]
- **KERFUR FIRST-REFUSAL (2026-07-12 `ded3f793` [turn_off converge LIVE-FIRED 2x clean — take-10 log
  12:59:10-11, 0 cm; slated for retirement into the VM assembler per the plan]):**
  the death-watch poll's host turn_off converge premise ("the verb's fresh prop is UNTRACKED") died
  with spawn_authority Inc-1 (2026-07-10) — the per-tick FinishSpawningActor seam drain expressed the
  conversion prop first, the poll's converge found it tracked and silently released the dead NPC with
  NO KerfurConvert (take-8 14:43 five-for-five; the peer kept the NPC mirror + gained a generic prop
  mirror = the toggle dupe). **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-14 (`de3dccb5`):** the SUPPRESSION now gates on the
  DETERMINISTIC `kerfur_form_assembler::IsCapturedForm` (this prop IS the captured conversion successor)
  — NOT the "dead un-handled kerfur-NPC within 5 m" PROXY below, which RACED the `dropKerfurProp` verb's
  spawn-vs-destroy order (NPC still alive at the prop's Init POST → declined → keyed express leaked →
  double-express dupe, 19:09 take). `TryAdoptFreshKerfurProp` keeps only its CONVERGE role (now gated
  behind the capture). The captured prop is TRACKED (so `host_spawn_watcher`/M2 defer) but its generic
  PropSpawn SUPPRESSED — track-but-don't-broadcast. See `[[project-kerfur-sole-express-dupe-2026-07-14]]`.
  **Historical (pre-`de3dccb5`) as-built:** every generic express lane (the shared Init-POST/ExpressSpawnedProp
  body + `BuildPropSpawnPayload_`) offered a fresh kerfur PROP to
  `kerfur_convert::TryAdoptFreshKerfurProp` FIRST: UNTRACKED + a dead un-handled kerfur-NPC watch
  within 5 m ⇒ converge at the spawn edge (silent register → BindFormActor → KerfurConvert); else
  (hand-place / purchase) the generic path keeps same-tick expression. Audit CRITICAL fixed pre-ship:
  the untracked-only guard (without it the Registry-fed builder site could only STEAL a standing
  off-prop's identity). RCA:

- **KERFUR EYE CAM = CHILD ACTOR, OUT OF THE PROP UNIVERSE (2026-07-12 `c93617be` [V — take-8

## NEEDS-PROBE (do not encode as truth without it)
- **[ANSWERED]** (trash redesign 08) PROBE-A: the carry slot is **`grabbing_actor`** (the PHC light-grab
  path, NOT `holding_actor`) — confirmed by the carry-churn finding + the autotest. (The old sub-question
  "which `OnPileGrabPre` early-return fires on a live CLIENT" is MOOT — the client-grab recognition is a
  camera-ray cone, NOT suppress-native; no `lookAtActor` read is involved.
  `[[lesson-proxy-never-lookatactor-use-camera-cone]]`.)
- **[ANSWERED — YES (engage), 2026-06-22]** does `playerGrabbed(Player=puppet)` drive the grab on a PUPPET
  (host executes a client's grab intent)? **The grab ENGAGES + HOLDS on an unpossessed puppet**
  (`grabbing_actor := clump`, no `GetController`/PlayerController/possession dependency — RE + the runtime
  probe `VOTVCOOP_RUN_PUPPET_GRAB_PROBE`, commit `32ccd1bc`). **BUT the puppet's tick does NOT drive the
  per-tick PHC** (the clump floats at the spawn spot, `TRACKED=0`), so the host kinematically drives the
  held-clump pose (`coop/puppet_carry_drive`, `81e8e687`). Finding:
  `research/findings/player-puppet/votv-puppet-grab-feasibility-RE-2026-06-22.md`. This is the Increment-2 gate, now
  RESOLVED + the host-side BUILT [V harness].
- **[ANSWERED — NO, 2026-06-21]** does the `BeginDeferred`/`FinishSpawning` POST fire for the clump↔pile
  convert? **It does NOT** — the chipPile/clump caller issues it `EX_CallMath` (0 fires, 870 piles + every
  re-pile, commit `0e56ca39`). The deterministic catch is the **`UFunction::Func` thunk patch — now AS-BUILT**
  (`ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`, commit `d19ae4d4`; offsets pinned + read-only-validated).
- **[ANSWERED — RESOLVED, 2026-06-21]** the thunk-hook offsets on the shipping binary: `FFrame::Object`@0x18,
  `FFrame::Locals`@0x28, `UFunction::Func`@0xD8 — IDA-pinned + validated by the read-only log pass
  (`B7EEB1BF`); the spawned actor is read from `*Result` (not `Locals+returnOff`). Shipped in
  `ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`. *(RETIRED morph [?]s removed: the "clump→holding_actor" link [it's grabbing_actor] + the land-claim/re-seed timing margin.)*
- **[?]** NPC/WorldActor client-suppression assumes spawner BPs null-check before `FinishSpawningActor`
  (UE4 convention; not IDA-confirmed on VOTV spawners).
- **[?]** WorldActor 16-name allowlist completeness / all-spawn-via-BeginDeferred — smoke-pending.

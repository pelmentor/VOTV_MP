## TL;DR — what a kerfur IS (the two forms)

A kerfur has **TWO distinct actor forms, different classes** (RE-verified, not a flag toggle):
- **Active = `kerfurOmega_C`** (an NPC / ACharacter sibling; ~20 data-only skin subclasses incl.
  `kerfurOmega_col_C` / `kerfurOmega_col_gamer_C`). Its radial menu is `kerfurOmega_C::actionName`.
- **Off object = `prop_kerfurOmega_C`** (a PROP, `Aprop_C`-derived, has an eid in the prop pipeline;
  skin subclasses likewise). Its radial menu is `prop_kerfurOmega_C::actionOptionIndex`.

**turn_off** (`actionName "turn_off"`) -> ubergraph `if (kill) return;` -> `dropKerfurProp()`
[PE-invisible EX_CallMath]: spawns `prop_kerfurOmega` **at the kerfur's own transform** (or `(0,0,20000)`
only `when isInFleshRoom`), copies `sentient`, optionally drops the carried floppy, then
**K2_DestroyActor()s the NPC**. **turn-on** (`actionOptionIndex Action==8`) -> `spawnKerfuro()`: spawns
the NPC, destroys the prop. So conversion is **destroy-one-class + spawn-the-other-class**, all
**BP-internal / ProcessEvent-INVISIBLE** (the central RE fact -- our single ProcessEvent detour never
sees the verb, the spawn, or the destroy).

## Why coop is hard here (the central trap)

Every spawn/destroy inside the conversion verbs is `EX_CallMath BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` /
by-name `K2_DestroyActor` -- **none dispatch through ProcessEvent**, so interceptors on
`actionName`/`actionOptionIndex`/`BeginDeferred` NEVER fire for the conversion (proven: zero firings in
real sessions). Detection is therefore a **death-watch POLL** (`kerfur_convert::PollKerfurConversions`,
5 Hz): *a kerfur mirror Element whose actor DIED while its wire Element is still present == the local
game just converted it.* See [[lesson-ex-callmath-invisible-to-processevent]].

## The sync architecture (as-built)

| form | sync channel | identity |
|---|---|---|
| active NPC | `npc_sync` -> EntitySpawn/EntityPose (host registers host-owned `Npc` Element, `m_mirror=false`, in `MirrorManager<Npc>`) | host-range eid + stable `KerfurId` (`kerfur_entity`) |
| OFF prop | `kerfur_convert` -> **`KerfurConvert` broadcast** (NOT npc_sync; the off form is a prop) | same `KerfurId`, rebound IN PLACE to a new prop eid via `BindFormActor` |

**The conversion is ONE entity changing form, not a destroy+create across two pipelines** (redesign
10.3): `BindFormActor` rebinds the stable `KerfurId` in place and broadcasts the SOLE transition signal
`KerfurConvert{oldEid, newEid, toForm, class, pose}`. The client `OnKerfurConvert` destroys the old-form
mirror + materializes the new form (adopting its own parked conversion-ghost if it initiated).

**The fix split: TWO fixes, not three.** 1+3 share a root (kerfur object identity falls to position-fuzzy +
no save-time reconcile) -> ONE save-time-exact-key fix (doc 03). Symptom 2 (camera) is independent (doc 04).
Order: 1+3 first (kills dup + collision), then 2 (gives the hopeless kerfur a body).

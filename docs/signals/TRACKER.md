# Signal-processing subsystem — living status tracker

**Update every session.** One row per signal-desk element: native behavior, the coop shape, who
owns it, the wire lane, and the honest status. STATUS legend (docs-piles discipline): **VERIFIED**
(hands-on or matching live log — say which) · **AS-BUILT** (shipped, not yet hands-on) · **DESIGN**
(designed, not built) · **OPEN** (gap, no design) · **N/A** (deliberately per-player).

The RNG-authority PROGRESS of the download machine lives in `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md` T2-5b — this
tracker points there. Wire-lane discoverability lives in `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md`. Neither is restated here.

## BUGS-v111 — the 2026-07-16 hands-on verdict (5 bugs, ALL root-caused)

> **FIX AS-BUILT (v112, same day):** all five designed out by the 12-round fix /qf
> (`votv-desk-input-lane-DESIGN-2026-07-16.md`) and BUILT: the claim-free field-granular
> `DeskInput=97` lane + `DeskScanEvent=98` + the 7-channel per-channel-exact-snap DeskSimPose +
> cooldown charge events + kPrefixes={CDOWN}. kProtocolVersion **112**, DLL `C4C1E69A…` deployed
> x4, autonomous LAN smoke PASS (45 s steady, logs clean, retired lanes silent). **NOT hands-on
> verified yet** — the take: client presses knobs/toggles at the download unit and they apply on
> the host + sounds play on both peers + 1/2/3 cooldown works on the client + SHIFT arrows appear
> on the mirror + detector 100% beeps once. The bullets below are the v111 diagnosis (historical).
**The axis fact:** the desk claim NEVER engages for the download unit's world-space buttons
(claim rides only the intComs `activeInterface` edge; physical +1/+5/+15/toggle presses don't set
it) → the whole v111 occupant-intent lane was dead during the test.

- **BUG-1 cooldown erased (client)** — the v111 `cooldown` stream channel raw-writes
  `coord_cooldown` every pump tick with the host's 0; both uplinks discard the client's charge
  (`console_state_sync.cpp:601` keep-local gate; `:206` unclaimed exclusion). Unwinnable race.
- **BUG-2 client knob input dead** — speed intents exist only on the (never-engaged) claimed
  lane; the client's local integrator output is overwritten by the stream. PLUS the reverse
  defect: `(dlDownloading>0)` flaps misclassified as input rebroadcast the client's stale zero
  scalars every ~3 s and stomp the HOST's knobs (`console_state_sync.cpp:217`).
- **BUG-3 sounds dead** — gauge volume ≡ match × |speed| and the speeds ride NO lane → mirror
  peers hear silence; the flap re-applies cut the host's envelope too. Data starvation, not a
  missing audio call.
- **BUG-4 detector stuck-beep (client)** — `SimInterp` never snaps to exactly 1.0 (window
  reopened by every 10 Hz packet; sub-ulp increments freeze just under 1.0), the client's own
  UNSUPPRESSED detector block re-crosses the threshold every frame → `beep_detecFinish` loops.
- **BUG-5 SHIFT scan + coordLog lines unmirrored** — quick-scan is on no lane at all; the
  `CR:`/`APPROXIMATION:`/`ANALYSIS:` log families are filtered off the wire on a premise
  ("regenerate from mirrored scalars") that is MEASURED false — they gate on input bools /
  `coord_pingStage` that never mirror (`console_state_sync.cpp:328-335`).

Fix pass = its own `/qf 15` (user green-light pending). The claim-model axis fact suggests the
fix is architectural, not five patches
(`[[feedback-recurring-bug-is-architectural]]`).

## OPEN items — detail

### OPEN-0 · Freq/polarity + download-rate SIM — AS-BUILT v111; hands-on 2026-07-16 FAILED → BUGS-v111
**As-built (`desk_sim_sync`, `MsgType::DeskSimPose=38`, proto→111):** host owns the sim + streams the
8-float output vector (decoded/resDetec/rate/frData/poData/frOffset/poOffset/cooldown) unreliable ~10 Hz,
newest-wins; client interpolates (multi-channel LerpWindow, cursor pattern) + OVERWRITES its local sim
(the self-accrued garbage never shows). Knob INTENTS stay occupant-authored on DeskState; the live
DeskState apply keeps the local sim-output fields (gate 1: one author). The `/qf` collapsed a suspected
sim-migration to this small fix by measurement: seed-sync refuted (unseeded+transient noise), frData/poData
stream host-auth (NOT rely on native convergence — OPEN-3 upgrade lane absent), coordLog kept separate
(OPEN-2). Audit READY (0 CRITICAL; hot paths O(1), raw-writes offset-guarded, gate-1 one-author). Full
design trail: scratchpad qf_thread.md. **Take (verify):** freq/pol numbers match on both peers + the knob
ramp is smooth not stepped; a 110-vs-111 pair HARD-CLOSEs at the gate.

**Root (MEASURED 2026-07-15, `2de202ed` desk_diag probe):** the entire download sim runs per-peer.
End-state host `decoded=0.0064 pol=1` vs client `decoded=0.0262 pol=0` — different progress AND
polarity with the same setup. `DL_downloading` folds two per-peer RNG terms (detector needle
`DL_resDetecPercent` = `RandomFloatInRange`, `noise` = `RandomFloat`) plus locally-integrated
freq/pol filter offsets → two peers download at different speeds = a live MECHANIC desync.

**Fix (DESIGN, not built — needs its own `/qf 15`):** shape-3 host-authoritative sim — the host runs
the tick, rolls both RNG, owns the outputs (`DL_downloading`, `decoded`, `DL_resDetecPercent`,
`DL_frData`, `DL_poData`); the client SUPPRESSES its own accrual + RNG and mirrors. The freq/pol
knobs are **host-sim-inputs**: client button presses are INTENT up; the host owns the offset/speed/
dir value that drives ITS sim and streams the animated offset back (unreliable, interpolated like
the cursor) for the mirror's display. Every mutator is `EX_Let`/`EX_Local*` → dispatch-invisible →
MIRROR STATE + SUPPRESS the local sim, never verb-hook
(`[[lesson-votv-world-system-sync-mirror-state-not-verb]]`,
`[[lesson-rng-in-rate-path-is-mechanic-desync]]`).
- RE + field-ownership table: `research/findings/computers-devices/votv-desk-download-machine-RE-2026-07-15.md`.
- RNG-authority row: `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md` **T2-5b** (AS-BUILT v111; hands-on 2026-07-16 FAILED → BUGS-v111).
- **TAKE (verify line):** host + client show the same `decoded %` and the same detector-needle
  position with identical freq/pol knobs, and the download HALTS on both when either knob is zeroed.

### OPEN-1 · Desk cursor degrades to ~5 fps mid-session
The v109 cursor is SMOOTH on a fresh session (user-verified) but has been observed dropping to ~5 fps
part-way through a session. Cause unattributed (not yet reproduced deterministically). Logs:
`scratchpad/desk_divergence_crash_{HOST,CLIENT_1}_0715.log`. Not a divergence — a rate/transport
degradation on the shipped stream. **v115 UPDATE (2026-07-17): the user re-reported jerkiness
mid-v114-hands-on; two mechanisms were code-measured and removed (claim release/flap = interp
reset+snap; same-pos-new-seq packets reopening the fixed 33ms window = staircase at sender-fps
dips) — the v115 adaptive window + dedupe + claim-decoupling may close this OPEN entirely;
re-judge at the v115 take (a same-slot claim-flap WARN now attributes any residual).**
**v115b UPDATE (2026-07-17 eve): two MORE mechanisms attributed + removed with the phantom
ping-FSM fix (`de31889e`): the phantom was a PER-TICK uber machine running on the observer during
any ping, and both peers double-authored the right-screen console lines (measured 220+93
lines/min crossing simultaneously) = the "messages jerky like the cursor" report. Also MEASURED
CLEAN: the observer's apply cadence (desk_cursor applying-line spacing steady 5 s = 60 Hz through
the whole live session incl. the jerk window) — the apply side is exonerated. Residual lead: the
smoke env showed client `[WALK-TIME] sync:npc_client ~30 ms/tick` + HITCH-SRC net_pump ~30 ms
steady — a per-tick walk that heavy grows with NPC count = "jerky over time"; NOT measurable in
the live logs (that instrumentation was off there). Re-judge at the take; if jerks persist,
enable the WALK-TIME instrumentation and read `sync:npc_client` first.**
**v116 UPDATE (2026-07-17 nite): the live-env measurement noise is now REMOVED and the missing
instrument ADDED — the deployed inis had a closed-measurement diag battery still ON (kerfur_census=1:
a full ~281k-object GUObjectArray walk measured 8-25 ms EVERY 10 s inside sync:npc_client, + 6 more
probes); all flipped off in all 4 installs, desk_diag KEPT (the proven 1 Hz discriminator), and the
HOST gained perf_probe=1 — host fps was never measured in any prior take (the observer of the mirror
cursor IS the host). The npc_client ~30 ms/tick walk reproduced in the v116 smoke WITH census OFF ->
the walk itself (mirror Tick loop) is the remaining named suspect, smoke-env-conditioned. Attribution
set for take 4: host [perf] frames + desk_diag 1 Hz pacing + desk_cursor ema.**

### OPEN-3 · Upgrade-level sync (NOT a desk detail — its own surface; surfaced by OPEN-0 gate 2)
The freq/pol download formula reads upgrade fields (`upg_scanner`, `upg_downloadSpd`, filter-size) and
**there is NO live upgrade-sync lane in coop** (grep-confirmed 2026-07-15) — upgrades ride only the join
save-transfer (seeded once). So a mid-session filter-upgrade purchase diverges silently. The desk build
(OPEN-0) ROUTES AROUND this by streaming `frData`/`poData` host-authoritatively (6 scalars), so the desk
freq/pol screens converge regardless — **upgrade-sync is NOT needed for OPEN-0**. But upgrades are shared
state with ≥2 display consumers (desk freq/pol derivation + the PC screen), so this is its own workstream.
**Purchase-authority is UNKNOWN and gates the whole design:** if a CLIENT can initiate an upgrade
purchase, it is a client-event→host-authoritative write (the kerfur seam — dupe risk); if host-only, a
simple mirror. **RE the purchase path FIRST** (which fields, who writes, is the purchase `EX_Local*`?),
reconcile with the join-transfer seed, THEN `/qf` the ownership. Do not bolt onto a desk build.

### OPEN-2 · The console_state_sync divergence cluster (ONE root, five symptoms)
Per the 2026-07-15 stress test: MOST desk/console OUTPUT is generated per-peer, not holder-owned +
mirrored. Symptoms: (1) **coordLog** — `ProduceLogLines` runs on every peer and the `CR:` family is
filtered off the wire (host 78 vs client 13 lines; the v109 cursor fix WOKE the host's mirrored
cursor into appending local `MOVE_*` lines); (2) **decode/detector %** = OPEN-0; (3) **freq/polarity
filter values** on no wire lane = OPEN-0; (4) **dishes** aim/slew per-peer = OPEN-4;
(5) **stationary PC** power + screen not mirrored. The fix is shape-4 done properly — the holder/host
owns the sim + the log, non-holders mirror the full state and SUPPRESS local generation. Design +
`/qf` it as one root (`[[project-desk-console-sync-2026-07-15]]`).
**2026-07-16 update [MEASURED]:** the `IsAnimatedLogLine` filter premise is now measured FALSE for
`CR:`/`APPROXIMATION:`/`ANALYSIS:` (they gate on `move_*` input bools / `coord_pingStage`, which
never mirror — only `CDOWN:` is regenerable from streamed state). The buffer is
`coord_coordLog2Text @0x0BF8` via `writeToCoordLog_2` (append, Right-capped 1000 chars; the
sibling `writeToCoordLog`/`coord_coordLogText` are DEAD code). = BUG-5's second half.

Legacy fact base (RE, still authoritative for the mechanics):
RE: `votv-dish-rotation-RE-2026-07-16.md` + **impl-gap addendum
`votv-dish-impl-RE-2026-07-16.md` (2026-07-16 eve, 5-agent pass)**: components/write path
(axis_Z=Yaw, axis_Y=ROLL, relative frame; K2_SetRelativeRotation precedent), stop()/kill stale
set (audio cues + `activeDishes[i]` — the OnKeyDown ping-block gate makes it load-bearing),
mirror-vs-live-loop = arrival STARVATION (never co-write), ticker kill/restore seams
(ClearTimer "do" / TickEnabled), pak-wide census (slew starters = desk ping + ticker_disher
ONLY; axis writers = dish uber ONLY), status-UI chain (desk 20 Hz pusher; getDir() live —
mirrored pose feeds the panel free), arm chain (dishesStop handler = formDownload(0,-1) only;
checkFordDishes tail gamemode-inline; **polarity per-peer RNG at arm(-1)**; begin() NOT
cosmetic — RT + camera + triggers + prop_argm spawn hazard), calibrate-terminal = client-side
per-frame calibration writer. Open design decisions listed at the addendum's tail (own-ping
kill-vs-let-run, ARM transport, begin() limbs, calibration authority, park cleanup set).
Pre-L4 divergence picture (FIXED by the build above; kept for context):
catch TARGETS synced (`SkySignalCatch` replays
`StartMovingAll`); everything else diverged: **rest pose is per-peer RNG at BeginPlay
(`randrot`: yaw 0-360, pitch 90-135) and orientation is NEVER SAVED** (no save channel to fight);
per-slew RNG (MaxSpeed 4.5-5.5, start delay 1-12 s, phase delays, calibration decay per frame);
the `isMoving` gate silently DROPS a catch target on a dish already slewing (ticker_disher fires
per-peer); the download-arming `dishesStop` edge fires at each peer's own last-dish time.
Ambient tickers (`ticker_disher` timing, `ticker_dishUncalib` target pick) are per-peer RNG →
RNG-authority rows. Identity for logging: `Index` + `techName` (NATO from Bravo, no Alpha) +
`Key`. User ask 2026-07-16: per-dish logging (cls+key+loc rule).

### OPEN-5 · The drive chain (payload + slot + eraser) — RE'd, zero lanes
`prop_drive.Data_0 @0x550` (the signal payload incl. the identity string) is mutated by FOUR
verbs (deck import/export, comp swap, eraser wipe, level-up) — all EX_Local*/inline, NO wire
lane (`grep prop_drive src/votv-coop` = 0). The mirror drive keeps a stale payload → wrong
LED/hover AND a later interaction on the other peer acts on stale data (dupe/loss risk on the
move semantics — the list row was deleted on one peer only). `driveSlot` FSM (freeze+teleport,
`drive.slot` pointer, `isRecentlyDetached` latch) also unsynced — insertion crosses the wire only
as a generic prop move. The eraser adds a 3 s `processing` latch + the wipe. **Identity note:**
the signal `id` is minted per-peer (`GenerateRandomBytes(16)`) at U2-save and RE-MINTED at every
comp level-up — do NOT design any coop identity on it without a host-authority pass.

### OPEN-6 · U3 play deck outputs — **BUILT v117 (2026-07-18; smoke x2 + e2e self-test, NOT hands-on)**

> **AS-BUILT:** `coop/interactables/deck_play_sync` per
> `votv-deck-play-L6-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md` (7-round /qf; the arch doc's 250 ms poll
> REVISED to seam detection per its own tier rule; + the gen guard). The row above is the
> as-built truth. SARV `remapValue` remains per-desk display-local (pure contrast remap, no
> signal data — deliberately unsynced; spectrum jitter per-peer cosmetic). Legacy fact base:
`signalSound` is a WORLD-audible component (`SetSound(level-variant)` + Activate) — a nearby
non-occupant natively heard nothing; playback state panes are rebuilt by the mirror's own
playSignal replay from the synced deck row + static DataTable. Scroll/select/volume ride
DeskInput (v112).

### OPEN-7 · Tape caddy + daily task — **BUILT v114 (2026-07-17; smoke PASS, NOT hands-on)**

> **AS-BUILT (commit `ba8ce297`, proto 114, DLL `13874C48D3D7F220` x4):** impl design
> `votv-tape-caddy-L7-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-17.md` (9-round /qf "that holds") built as designed:
> `coop/interactables/tape_caddy_sync` (ReelSlot=102 presser sentinel edges 4 Hz + ReelPose=40
> host 1 Hz corrector; client accrual NOT parked — written park-doctrine deviation, upd()
> makes a park un-holdable) + `coop/world/daily_task_sync` (TaskNewState=103 host change-hash
> mirror; every live writer host-only by census) + the savedScalar identity-at-birth channel
> (PropSpawn/_pad2 + flag 0x40; PropDropIntent 168->172 — BOTH intent kinds carry it) +
> ReelEjectIntent=104 (client-eject birth via the F2 author, reel-class whitelist). The
> `active` toggle stays on the ApplianceState lane. Residuals R1-R5 named in the design doc
> (R1: client-loaded sack contents can't grade until the sack-contents lane). Legacy fact
> base below (still authoritative for the mechanics).
RE: `votv-tape-caddy-daily-task-RE-2026-07-16.md`. The wallunit is the concreteBucket class
(`COOP_WORLD_PROP_DIVERGENCE`): 1 Hz `+= dt/speed` accrual per peer on both reels; `speed`
written cross-object by desk physMods (byte 21); eject/insert/toggle local-only (the reel PROPS
do cross the generic spawn/destroy seams). The daily grade rides `saveSlot.taskNew.reel_big/
small` via drone `sell` (reads struct_save snapshots; reward only if BOTH > 0) + the day-rollover
`processTask`. Host-owned prop sim + taskNew mirroring wanted; join transfer already seeds both.

### OPEN-8 · physMods (desk physical modules) — **BUILT v118 (2026-07-18; smoke PASS + join canonical proven, NOT hands-on)**

> **AS-BUILT:** `coop/interactables/physmods_sync` + `ue_wrap/desk/phys_mods` per
> `votv-physmods-L8-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md` (8-round /qf; 4 self-caught corrections incl.
> the UNPLUG-path reframe — "modules permanent" was false — and the explosion-damage-path
> retraction). The master-table row is the as-built truth. Consumers (tape speed byte 21,
> lamps/auto-continue 3, laptop-fwd 5, weather shield 6) converge via the mirrored
> updPhysMods (measured a pure function of the array). The OPEN-7 speed gate is now fed.
Legacy: 12 slots; plug destroys the module prop; the explotano hot-op explosion is
presser-local natively (explosion_C targets the local player only — measured).

### OPEN-10 · Laptop v2: PC file buffer + the portable PC (NEW 2026-07-17, cut from v116 v1)
`laptop_C.floppyBuffer/floppyBufferUIDs` (files copied onto the PC; persisted; mutates only while a
peer drives the PC UI) + the sibling device `prop_portablePc_C` (own floppyTypes/floppyData) are
UNSYNCED. **The first design question is per-device claim discrimination**: `device_screen.cpp`
maps BOTH `laptop_C` AND `prop_portablePc_C` to the SAME occupancy claim key "laptop" — a
claim-release-authored buffer snapshot cannot tell which device the leaving holder drove, and two
peers on the two devices cannot both hold the claim (qf R7-Q4). Also here: the v116 content-cap
residual (>4 KB disc content truncates with a WARN) + the mid-session content-loss TTL fallback.
RE base: `votv-laptop-pc-RE-2026-07-17.md` FD-Q5/§4.

### OPEN-9 · Meadow DATABASE stores
`saveSlot.savedSignals_0 @0x680` (DATABASE tab) + `savedSignals_comp_0 @0x690` (processed DB) get
rows from U3 SAVE (`laptop.addSignal`, EX_Local-invisible) and laptop-side delete/move — join
save-transfer only, no live lane. Same intent-CRDT shape as the shipped
`SavedSignalAppend/Delete 58/59` (which cover the GAMEMODE list only).

## CHANGELOG
- **2026-07-18 (v118 `pending-commit`, L8 physMods)** — L8 built per its own 8-round /qf
  (value-ops + host-canonical array REVISING the arch's slot-deltas; the unplug path
  discovered — the R1 reframe; the explosion measured presser-local — an inference
  retracted). PhysModsState=108, proto 118; the kind-104 client-birth whitelist widened to
  desk modules. Smoke PASS + the joiner canonical hand-off proven in-log; audits pending at
  write time. OPEN-8 flipped AS-BUILT.
- **2026-07-18 (v117 `pending-commit`, L6 deck playback)** — the event_dispatch_signal.cpp
  extraction landed first (e88cc5e0: the 18 signal-pipeline cases out of the 791-LOC state
  router; every future lane case lands in the signal family). Then L6 built per its own
  7-round /qf (design `votv-deck-play-L6-impl-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md`): PlayDeckEvent=107,
  proto 117, the 4th Func patch (Deactivate), the gen guard, the fin PE bracket. Smoke x2
  PASS + the e2e self-test chain proven end-to-end (organic mint -> wire -> gate-WARN ->
  stale-stop drop); perf audit PASS (ambient Deactivate ~26/s, miss path = 2 compares);
  correctness audit 0 CRIT/IMPORTANT. OPEN-6 row flipped AS-BUILT. NOT hands-on (take gains
  the v117 STEPS section). PRODUCT QUESTION (default NO): a deck-play activity-feed line.
- **2026-07-17 nite (v116 `613f2ac4` + ue_wrap split `9d24ac0c`, PUSHED)** — the take-3 live test
  (17:00-17:09) caught the LOST-CATCH root: the claim-gated catch detector raced the FSM-hold release
  the successful ping itself triggers (measured 17:04:46/47) -> the whole R2-R5 symptom set from ONE
  eaten edge. v116 retires the claim gates (/qf rounds 1-6), adds catch->activity-feed, and ships the
  laptop_C power+floppy lane (LaptopState=106, /qf rounds 7-9; RE `votv-laptop-pc-RE-2026-07-17.md`);
  proto 115->116. Diag-battery ini hygiene + host perf_probe (OPEN-1). Rows flipped: Signal catch ->
  v116; Stationary PC -> AS-BUILT v116 (was stale-OPEN "screens gap-list #5"); +OPEN-10. Smoke x3;
  NOT hands-on (runbook take 4, SIX layers).
- **2026-07-16** — the user walked the WHOLE downstream chain hands-on + reported 5 v111 bugs; a
  7-agent RE pass covered units 1-4 byte-level + the drive chain + eraser + tape caddy + the 24
  dishes; ALL 5 bugs root-caused to file:line (**BUGS-v111** section; the claim-model axis fact).
  New findings: `votv-signal-chain-units-RE-2026-07-16.md`,
  `votv-dish-rotation-RE-2026-07-16.md`, `votv-tape-caddy-daily-task-RE-2026-07-16.md`,
  `votv-desk-sim-v111-coop-bugs-audit-2026-07-16.md`. The 07-15 download RE §C SHIFT claim
  CORRECTED (SHIFT=quick-scan; the stage FSM belongs to ENTER; key router =
  `ui_consolesAtlas.OnKeyDown`). New rows OPEN-4..9. Master-table v111 row flipped AS-BUILT →
  hands-on FAILED. NEXT: the fix `/qf 15` over BUGS-v111 (claim-model axis first), then the
  downstream lanes.
- **2026-07-15 (later)** — OPEN-0 AS-BUILT v111 (`desk_sim_sync` / `DeskSimPose=38`, proto 110→111,
  DLL `84e431bef0bd6982` deployed x4). `/qf` design pass (5 measurement rounds) collapsed a suspected
  host-auth sim-migration to a small fix; audit READY (0 CRITICAL). NOT hands-on. Surfaced OPEN-3
  (upgrade-sync, its own workstream). coordLog (OPEN-2) kept separate.
- **2026-07-15** — folder created; the signal-processing saga given a home (was scattered across
  `research/findings/computers-devices/` + `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY` T2-5b + `COOP_SYNC_MAP`). Status
  reconciled to code: transport elements AS-BUILT/VERIFIED (cursor v109 SMOOTH, clock v110); the
  freq/pol + download SIM is the open gap (RE'd, divergence MEASURED, fix UNBUILT). Next: the
  download-machine host-authoritative `/qf`.

# Signal-processing subsystem — living status tracker

**Update every session.** One row per signal-desk element: native behavior, the coop shape, who
owns it, the wire lane, and the honest status. STATUS legend (docs-piles discipline): **VERIFIED**
(hands-on or matching live log — say which) · **AS-BUILT** (shipped, not yet hands-on) · **DESIGN**
(designed, not built) · **OPEN** (gap, no design) · **N/A** (deliberately per-player).

The RNG-authority PROGRESS of the download machine lives in `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md` T2-5b — this
tracker points there. Wire-lane discoverability lives in `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md`. Neither is restated here.

## BUGS-v111 — the 2026-07-16 hands-on verdict (5 bugs, ALL root-caused)

> **FIX AS-BUILT (v112, same day):** all five designed out by the 12-round fix /qf
> (`votv-desk-input-lane-DESIGN-2026-07-16.md`) and BUILT: the claim-free field-granular
> `DeskInput=97` lane + `DeskScanEvent=98` + the 7-channel per-channel-exact-snap DeskSimPose +
> cooldown charge events + kPrefixes={CDOWN}. kProtocolVersion **112**, DLL `C4C1E69A…` deployed
> x4, autonomous LAN smoke PASS (45 s steady, logs clean, retired lanes silent). **NOT hands-on
> verified yet** — the take: client presses knobs/toggles at the download unit and they apply on
> the host + sounds play on both peers + 1/2/3 cooldown works on the client + SHIFT arrows appear
> on the mirror + detector 100% beeps once. The bullets below are the v111 diagnosis (historical).
**The axis fact:** the desk claim NEVER engages for the download unit's world-space buttons
(claim rides only the intComs `activeInterface` edge; physical +1/+5/+15/toggle presses don't set
it) → the whole v111 occupant-intent lane was dead during the test.

- **BUG-1 cooldown erased (client)** — the v111 `cooldown` stream channel raw-writes
  `coord_cooldown` every pump tick with the host's 0; both uplinks discard the client's charge
  (`console_state_sync.cpp:601` keep-local gate; `:206` unclaimed exclusion). Unwinnable race.
- **BUG-2 client knob input dead** — speed intents exist only on the (never-engaged) claimed
  lane; the client's local integrator output is overwritten by the stream. PLUS the reverse
  defect: `(dlDownloading>0)` flaps misclassified as input rebroadcast the client's stale zero
  scalars every ~3 s and stomp the HOST's knobs (`console_state_sync.cpp:217`).
- **BUG-3 sounds dead** — gauge volume ≡ match × |speed| and the speeds ride NO lane → mirror
  peers hear silence; the flap re-applies cut the host's envelope too. Data starvation, not a
  missing audio call.
- **BUG-4 detector stuck-beep (client)** — `SimInterp` never snaps to exactly 1.0 (window
  reopened by every 10 Hz packet; sub-ulp increments freeze just under 1.0), the client's own
  UNSUPPRESSED detector block re-crosses the threshold every frame → `beep_detecFinish` loops.
- **BUG-5 SHIFT scan + coordLog lines unmirrored** — quick-scan is on no lane at all; the
  `CR:`/`APPROXIMATION:`/`ANALYSIS:` log families are filtered off the wire on a premise
  ("regenerate from mirrored scalars") that is MEASURED false — they gate on input bools /
  `coord_pingStage` that never mirror (`console_state_sync.cpp:328-335`).

Fix pass = its own `/qf 15` (user green-light pending). The claim-model axis fact suggests the
fix is architectural, not five patches
(`[[feedback-recurring-bug-is-architectural]]`).

## OPEN items — detail

### OPEN-0 · Freq/polarity + download-rate SIM — AS-BUILT v111; hands-on 2026-07-16 FAILED → BUGS-v111
**As-built (`desk_sim_sync`, `MsgType::DeskSimPose=38`, proto→111):** host owns the sim + streams the
8-float output vector (decoded/resDetec/rate/frData/poData/frOffset/poOffset/cooldown) unreliable ~10 Hz,
newest-wins; client interpolates (multi-channel LerpWindow, cursor pattern) + OVERWRITES its local sim
(the self-accrued garbage never shows). Knob INTENTS stay occupant-authored on DeskState; the live
DeskState apply keeps the local sim-output fields (gate 1: one author). The `/qf` collapsed a suspected
sim-migration to this small fix by measurement: seed-sync refuted (unseeded+transient noise), frData/poData
stream host-auth (NOT rely on native convergence — OPEN-3 upgrade lane absent), coordLog kept separate
(OPEN-2). Audit READY (0 CRITICAL; hot paths O(1), raw-writes offset-guarded, gate-1 one-author). Full
design trail: scratchpad qf_thread.md. **Take (verify):** freq/pol numbers match on both peers + the knob
ramp is smooth not stepped; a 110-vs-111 pair HARD-CLOSEs at the gate.

**Root (MEASURED 2026-07-15, `2de202ed` desk_diag probe):** the entire download sim runs per-peer.
End-state host `decoded=0.0064 pol=1` vs client `decoded=0.0262 pol=0` — different progress AND
polarity with the same setup. `DL_downloading` folds two per-peer RNG terms (detector needle
`DL_resDetecPercent` = `RandomFloatInRange`, `noise` = `RandomFloat`) plus locally-integrated
freq/pol filter offsets → two peers download at different speeds = a live MECHANIC desync.

**Fix (DESIGN, not built — needs its own `/qf 15`):** shape-3 host-authoritative sim — the host runs
the tick, rolls both RNG, owns the outputs (`DL_downloading`, `decoded`, `DL_resDetecPercent`,
`DL_frData`, `DL_poData`); the client SUPPRESSES its own accrual + RNG and mirrors. The freq/pol
knobs are **host-sim-inputs**: client button presses are INTENT up; the host owns the offset/speed/
dir value that drives ITS sim and streams the animated offset back (unreliable, interpolated like
the cursor) for the mirror's display. Every mutator is `EX_Let`/`EX_Local*` → dispatch-invisible →
MIRROR STATE + SUPPRESS the local sim, never verb-hook
(`[[lesson-votv-world-system-sync-mirror-state-not-verb]]`,
`[[lesson-rng-in-rate-path-is-mechanic-desync]]`).
- RE + field-ownership table: `research/findings/computers-devices/votv-desk-download-machine-RE-2026-07-15.md`.
- RNG-authority row: `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md` **T2-5b** (AS-BUILT v111; hands-on 2026-07-16 FAILED → BUGS-v111).
- **TAKE (verify line):** host + client show the same `decoded %` and the same detector-needle
  position with identical freq/pol knobs, and the download HALTS on both when either knob is zeroed.

### OPEN-1 · Desk cursor degrades to ~5 fps mid-session
The v109 cursor is SMOOTH on a fresh session (user-verified) but has been observed dropping to ~5 fps
part-way through a session. Cause unattributed (not yet reproduced deterministically). Logs:
`scratchpad/desk_divergence_crash_{HOST,CLIENT_1}_0715.log`. Not a divergence — a rate/transport
degradation on the shipped stream.

### OPEN-3 · Upgrade-level sync (NOT a desk detail — its own surface; surfaced by OPEN-0 gate 2)
The freq/pol download formula reads upgrade fields (`upg_scanner`, `upg_downloadSpd`, filter-size) and
**there is NO live upgrade-sync lane in coop** (grep-confirmed 2026-07-15) — upgrades ride only the join
save-transfer (seeded once). So a mid-session filter-upgrade purchase diverges silently. The desk build
(OPEN-0) ROUTES AROUND this by streaming `frData`/`poData` host-authoritatively (6 scalars), so the desk
freq/pol screens converge regardless — **upgrade-sync is NOT needed for OPEN-0**. But upgrades are shared
state with ≥2 display consumers (desk freq/pol derivation + the PC screen), so this is its own workstream.
**Purchase-authority is UNKNOWN and gates the whole design:** if a CLIENT can initiate an upgrade
purchase, it is a client-event→host-authoritative write (the kerfur seam — dupe risk); if host-only, a
simple mirror. **RE the purchase path FIRST** (which fields, who writes, is the purchase `EX_Local*`?),
reconcile with the join-transfer seed, THEN `/qf` the ownership. Do not bolt onto a desk build.

### OPEN-2 · The console_state_sync divergence cluster (ONE root, five symptoms)
Per the 2026-07-15 stress test: MOST desk/console OUTPUT is generated per-peer, not holder-owned +
mirrored. Symptoms: (1) **coordLog** — `ProduceLogLines` runs on every peer and the `CR:` family is
filtered off the wire (host 78 vs client 13 lines; the v109 cursor fix WOKE the host's mirrored
cursor into appending local `MOVE_*` lines); (2) **decode/detector %** = OPEN-0; (3) **freq/polarity
filter values** on no wire lane = OPEN-0; (4) **dishes** aim/slew per-peer = OPEN-4;
(5) **stationary PC** power + screen not mirrored. The fix is shape-4 done properly — the holder/host
owns the sim + the log, non-holders mirror the full state and SUPPRESS local generation. Design +
`/qf` it as one root (`[[project-desk-console-sync-2026-07-15]]`).
**2026-07-16 update [MEASURED]:** the `IsAnimatedLogLine` filter premise is now measured FALSE for
`CR:`/`APPROXIMATION:`/`ANALYSIS:` (they gate on `move_*` input bools / `coord_pingStage`, which
never mirror — only `CDOWN:` is regenerable from streamed state). The buffer is
`coord_coordLog2Text @0x0BF8` via `writeToCoordLog_2` (append, Right-capped 1000 chars; the
sibling `writeToCoordLog`/`coord_coordLogText` are DEAD code). = BUG-5's second half.

> **DESIGN CONVERGED for ALL of OPEN-4..9 (2026-07-16, /qf 9 rounds "that holds"):**
> `research/findings/computers-devices/votv-signal-chain-all-units-DESIGN-2026-07-16.md` —
> presser-authored state broadcasts + host-adopted sims + VM-bracket capture (HALT-gated on the
> 0x45 frequency probe); build order v112 → probe → L4 → L7 → L6 → L8 → L5 → L9. The BUGS-v111
> fix design converged separately (12 rounds): `votv-desk-input-lane-DESIGN-2026-07-16.md`
> (v112: claim-free DeskInput lane; impl in progress). The per-lane sections below remain the
> FACT base; the design doc is the plan of record.

### OPEN-4 · Dish rotation/kinematics (24 big dishes) — RE'd, unsynced
RE: `votv-dish-rotation-RE-2026-07-16.md`. Catch TARGETS already sync (`SkySignalCatch` replays
`StartMovingAll`); everything else diverges: **rest pose is per-peer RNG at BeginPlay
(`randrot`: yaw 0-360, pitch 90-135) and orientation is NEVER SAVED** (no save channel to fight);
per-slew RNG (MaxSpeed 4.5-5.5, start delay 1-12 s, phase delays, calibration decay per frame);
the `isMoving` gate silently DROPS a catch target on a dish already slewing (ticker_disher fires
per-peer); the download-arming `dishesStop` edge fires at each peer's own last-dish time.
Ambient tickers (`ticker_disher` timing, `ticker_dishUncalib` target pick) are per-peer RNG →
RNG-authority rows. Identity for logging: `Index` + `techName` (NATO from Bravo, no Alpha) +
`Key`. User ask 2026-07-16: per-dish logging (cls+key+loc rule).

### OPEN-5 · The drive chain (payload + slot + eraser) — RE'd, zero lanes
`prop_drive.Data_0 @0x550` (the signal payload incl. the identity string) is mutated by FOUR
verbs (deck import/export, comp swap, eraser wipe, level-up) — all EX_Local*/inline, NO wire
lane (`grep prop_drive src/votv-coop` = 0). The mirror drive keeps a stale payload → wrong
LED/hover AND a later interaction on the other peer acts on stale data (dupe/loss risk on the
move semantics — the list row was deleted on one peer only). `driveSlot` FSM (freeze+teleport,
`drive.slot` pointer, `isRecentlyDetached` latch) also unsynced — insertion crosses the wire only
as a generic prop move. The eraser adds a 3 s `processing` latch + the wipe. **Identity note:**
the signal `id` is minted per-peer (`GenerateRandomBytes(16)`) at U2-save and RE-MINTED at every
comp level-up — do NOT design any coop identity on it without a host-authority pass.

### OPEN-6 · U3 play deck outputs
`signalSound` is a WORLD-audible component (`SetSound(level-variant)` + Activate) — a nearby
non-occupant natively hears nothing; playback state (`play_selectIndex`, volume, SARV
`remapValue`, spectrum/typewriter panes) is per-desk local. Scroll/select is occupant-authored.
Needs the holder-owned shape; low risk, but the audible half is player-visible.

### OPEN-7 · Tape caddy + daily task
RE: `votv-tape-caddy-daily-task-RE-2026-07-16.md`. The wallunit is the concreteBucket class
(`COOP_WORLD_PROP_DIVERGENCE`): 1 Hz `+= dt/speed` accrual per peer on both reels; `speed`
written cross-object by desk physMods (byte 21); eject/insert/toggle local-only (the reel PROPS
do cross the generic spawn/destroy seams). The daily grade rides `saveSlot.taskNew.reel_big/
small` via drone `sell` (reads struct_save snapshots; reward only if BOTH > 0) + the day-rollover
`processTask`. Host-owned prop sim + taskNew mirroring wanted; join transfer already seeds both.

### OPEN-8 · physMods (desk physical modules)
12 slots; plug destroys the module prop (generic destroy lane covers the prop only); the ARRAY +
its consumers (tape speed byte 21, level lamps + auto-continue byte 3, laptop auto-forward byte
5, weather shield byte 6) + the `explotano` hot-plug explosion are unsynced. Gates OPEN-7 speed
and U4 behavior.

### OPEN-9 · Meadow DATABASE stores
`saveSlot.savedSignals_0 @0x680` (DATABASE tab) + `savedSignals_comp_0 @0x690` (processed DB) get
rows from U3 SAVE (`laptop.addSignal`, EX_Local-invisible) and laptop-side delete/move — join
save-transfer only, no live lane. Same intent-CRDT shape as the shipped
`SavedSignalAppend/Delete 58/59` (which cover the GAMEMODE list only).

## CHANGELOG
- **2026-07-16** — the user walked the WHOLE downstream chain hands-on + reported 5 v111 bugs; a
  7-agent RE pass covered units 1-4 byte-level + the drive chain + eraser + tape caddy + the 24
  dishes; ALL 5 bugs root-caused to file:line (**BUGS-v111** section; the claim-model axis fact).
  New findings: `votv-signal-chain-units-RE-2026-07-16.md`,
  `votv-dish-rotation-RE-2026-07-16.md`, `votv-tape-caddy-daily-task-RE-2026-07-16.md`,
  `votv-desk-sim-v111-coop-bugs-audit-2026-07-16.md`. The 07-15 download RE §C SHIFT claim
  CORRECTED (SHIFT=quick-scan; the stage FSM belongs to ENTER; key router =
  `ui_consolesAtlas.OnKeyDown`). New rows OPEN-4..9. Master-table v111 row flipped AS-BUILT →
  hands-on FAILED. NEXT: the fix `/qf 15` over BUGS-v111 (claim-model axis first), then the
  downstream lanes.
- **2026-07-15 (later)** — OPEN-0 AS-BUILT v111 (`desk_sim_sync` / `DeskSimPose=38`, proto 110→111,
  DLL `84e431bef0bd6982` deployed x4). `/qf` design pass (5 measurement rounds) collapsed a suspected
  host-auth sim-migration to a small fix; audit READY (0 CRITICAL). NOT hands-on. Surfaced OPEN-3
  (upgrade-sync, its own workstream). coordLog (OPEN-2) kept separate.
- **2026-07-15** — folder created; the signal-processing saga given a home (was scattered across
  `research/findings/computers-devices/` + `COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY` T2-5b + `COOP_SYNC_MAP`). Status
  reconciled to code: transport elements AS-BUILT/VERIFIED (cursor v109 SMOOTH, clock v110); the
  freq/pol + download SIM is the open gap (RE'd, divergence MEASURED, fix UNBUILT). Next: the
  download-machine host-authoritative `/qf`.

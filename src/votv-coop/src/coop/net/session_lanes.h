// coop/net/session_lanes.h -- INTERNAL (src-tree) shared header for the GNS
// priority-lane mapping + the host-relay kind whitelist.
//
// Not a public API: it lives under src/ (not include/) and is included only by
// the Session implementation TUs (session.cpp + session_relay.cpp). It exists
// solely so the lane mapping is shared between the send paths (session.cpp's
// SendReliable / SendReliableToSlot) and the host-relay path
// (session_relay.cpp's RelayReliableToOtherClients) without duplicating the
// switch. Extracted at PR-FOUNDATION Tier 2 T2-3 when the relay subsystem
// moved into its own TU and session.cpp crossed the 800-LOC soft cap.
//
// The functions are `inline` (external linkage, ODR-safe across the two TUs);
// they were previously file-local (anon-namespace) inside session.cpp.

// pickupObjectDirect(clump) + K2_DestroyActor(self)), all dispatched BP-internally (EX_LocalVirtualFunction

// ProcessEvent). docs/piles/08 makes the HOST grab sync WITHOUT acting here: the BP's own BeginDeferred is
// caught at the host_spawn_watcher convert-spawn POST (host-authoritative, zero-proximity). So this
// observer is now PROBE-A only (Increment 1): it logs the carry-slot the clump rides so the client-grab

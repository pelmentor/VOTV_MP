// CONSOLIDATED 2026-06-30 (anti-smear refactor, [[feedback-one-owner-order-axis]]) from:
//   - coop/element/identity_reconcile.cpp  (the SEQUENCE + the steady-state trigger), and
//   - coop/props/pile_reconcile.cpp groups B+C  (the deferred QUEUES the sequence drained:
//     save-time twins, b3 pos-corrections, destroy-before-load; + HasPendingWork + Reset).
// Both were two halves of ONE concept (the drain-edge reconcile order axis) split across two
// folders + two namespaces, with a GENERIC kerfur destroy queue living in a "pile"-named file.
// The kerfur off->active retire's SEQUENCING also folds in here: it was a THIRD parallel order
// owner driven from kerfur_convert::PollKerfurConversions; now the ONE sequence calls the kerfur
// retire MECHANISM (kerfur_reconcile, which STAYS its own module, like save_identity_bind).

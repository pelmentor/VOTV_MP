    // Complete on Lane::Bulk; SnapshotComplete only ARMS the sweep -- agent-verified 2026-06-23),

    // the sweep's Registry doom above MISSES -- a level-native enters the Prop Registry lazily, so

    // these surviving natives, grabs it through the REAL interaction system (it is a real
    // actorChipPile_C, not our proxy), so no GrabIntent is sent and the host never sees the grab.
    //
    // READ-ONLY for now (absence-removal is Phase 2): band each orphan by the distance to the
    // nearest live PILE-form proxy + log the histogram, so the removal thresholds come from REAL
    // host-drift data (measure before cut). DIVERGES from MTA, which removes purely by ID/
    // membership (Client/.../CPacketHandler.cpp Packet_EntityRemove deletes only the exact IDs the
    // server names, never by position): our chipPiles are KEYLESS + deterministically level-placed,
    // so the host pile and the client native share NO cross-peer id -> position is the only key.
    // MTA's client starts EMPTY (it never holds a local save), so it never has this orphan class;
    // the position+valve approach is the justified adaptation (RULE 2026-05-28 divergence note --
    // the >50%% valve is the partial-snapshot guard MTA gets for free from its empty-start + JOINED
    // gate). Cold path (once per join), bounded (a few dozen leftovers x a proxy-set walk each).
    // ALWAYS log when the index was built this bracket -- even 0 orphans. A CLEAN join drains the index
    // to EMPTY (every twin matched within 1cm), and gating on non-empty made a 0-orphan join SILENT --
    // indistinguishable from a census that never ran (the exact ambiguity the 2026-06-23 clean same-machine
    // smoke hit: 869 built, all matched, no [PILE-CENSUS] line -> looked broken). The summary line is the
    // proof the census ran + the count; N=0 on a clean join is the expected, INFORMATIVE result.
    // FRESH walk at the sweep (GC-ROBUST) -- do NOT re-use g_pileBindIndex's build-time internal indices.
    // The 2026-06-23 calibration proved why: a mass-purge runs right at the sweep (prop_element_tracker
    // reaps 256 dead Prop Elements/call, draining the join-tail backlog -- log-confirmed at the SAME second
    // as the sweep, repeating every ~4s), churning the GUObjectArray so every stored internalIdx goes STALE

// ---- The client-grab INTERCEPTOR on InpActEvt_use (docs/piles/08) ------------------------------------
//
// DECISIVE RE (votv-pile-grab-observable-hook-RE-2026-06-08-pass1.md): a chipPile grab is the E-press
// input action AmainPlayer_C::InpActEvt_use_..._41 -> icast(lookAtActor)->playerGrabbed (spawn clump +
// pickupObjectDirect(clump) + K2_DestroyActor(self)), all dispatched BP-internally (EX_LocalVirtualFunction
// -> ProcessInternal) and INVISIBLE to our ProcessEvent detour. InpActEvt_use itself IS ProcessEvent-visible
// (the native input->UFunction dispatch), and it is a thin stub: `CALL ExecuteUbergraph_mainPlayer(112867)`
// -- the whole use flow (the grab AND `useAction`, which plays `use_deny` on its fail branches) is that one
// event's ubergraph entry.
//
// This is a PRE-INTERCEPTOR (returns true -> the native InpActEvt_use dispatch is CANCELLED entirely, never
// reaching the ubergraph). On the CLIENT, whenever we route the press to the host (a pile GRAB or a carry
// THROW), we return true: the native grab AND its `use_deny` "EHHH" both die at the source (RE 2026-07-01 --
// nulling lookAtActor was a HALF-suppression: it killed the grab but `useAction` re-traces on its own and
// still hit a deny branch, playing use_deny in parallel with our synthesized pickup cue -- the suppression
// axis, not delivery). For any non-pile E-press (and for the HOST, which grabs natively) we return false ->
// the native use runs unchanged (devices, legit denies, the host's own grab). Puppets are unpossessed ->
// never process input -> this only ever fires for the local player.
// The "use" action has THREE delegate bindings (mainPlayer.json Export 483): _41 (IE_Pressed, the grab press we
// fully intercept below), _38 (a SECOND IE_Pressed), and _42 (IE_Released). All three reach useAction's use_deny
// "EHHH". Hooking only _41 left _38 firing on every E-press -> the native deny played in PARALLEL with our
// cancelled grab (the 19:06 regression -- RE 2026-07-01: the deny is on a SEPARATE seam than the one _41
// cancels). This SIDE-EFFECT-FREE suppressor covers the SECOND PRESS seam (_38): on a CLIENT pile interaction
// it only CANCELS the dispatch (kills the parallel deny) -- it does NOT send a grab/throw intent or play a cue
// (_41 is the sole author of those). Same recognition as OnPileUseIntercept's client branch: carrying, or aimed
// at ANY native pile (bound or unbound -- the 2026-07-03 twin-grab gate) / proxy pile. On cancel it ARMS the

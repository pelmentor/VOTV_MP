// Element state) + Stop the session, then FLEE to the main menu with our layer held
// dormant. The full investigation (4 hands-on + an autonomous probe arc) established:
//   - The balloon is VOTV's OWN possessed-ragdoll leak in the GAMEPLAY world (~165 MB/s
//     to OOM). VOTV's native death never leaves the world -- it just leaves you
//     ragdolling. So the cure is to LEAVE the gameplay world.
//   - `disconnect` is a no-op (no UE netdriver); raw `open menu` does not travel
//     (short name unresolved); VOTV travels via its OWN verb mainGamemode_C::transition
//     ("/Game/menu", full path) -- engine::ReturnToMainMenu. This works for a DEAD/
//     ragdolling player (a direct call, no pause needed).
//   - Our ProcessEvent detour HANGS the 50k-actor untitled_1 teardown (it dispatches
//     ReceiveEndPlay per dying actor through us) AND, after the menu loads, our per-tick
//     coop logic resuming on stale gameplay prop shadows balloons RAM ~1 min later. The
//     fix for BOTH is to HOLD the detour in transparent bypass (game_thread::
//     SetTransparentBypass) over the travel + the time at the menu -> our layer is fully
//     dormant. Validated: RSS flat + trending DOWN for 160 s (the old world frees).
// Latched once per death; reset by OnSessionStart so a rejoin (relaunch) re-arms.
bool g_localDeathHandled = false;

// How long to hold the transparent bypass after a local-death flee to the menu. This
// covers ONLY the world-teardown window -- the bypass exists so VOTV's 50k-actor
// untitled_1 teardown + menu travel runs with our ProcessEvent detour dormant (our
// observers + the outer SEH otherwise hang the per-actor EndPlay swap -- game_thread.cpp
// :34-37, which documents the bypass as a TEARDOWN-window tool that "auto-expires so the
// fresh menu world runs with our layer fully normal again"). Once the menu world is up
// the detour MUST resume, because:
//   - the menu's MULTIPLAYER button is injected by a POST observer on ui_menu_C::Tick
//     (multiplayer_menu.cpp) dispatched THROUGH the detour; a held bypass starves it, so
//     the death-menu loses MULTIPLAYER and the player can't rejoin -- which the
//     permadeath-REJOINABLE death policy explicitly depends on (vitals-death RE 4.5).
//   - resuming at the menu is SAFE: TickGameplay is world-up-gated (Local()==null at the
//     menu) and the prop reaper is gameplay-world-gated (inert at the menu) -- the v56/v57
//     churn fix (2026-06-10) is the REAL menu-safety, not this bypass. The old 30-min hold
//     PREDATED those gates and only kept our layer dormant to dodge the reaper churn; with
//     the gate in place that hold is RULE-2 baggage (this file's own reaper comment already
//     notes "the gameplay-world gate on the prop reaper keeps it from churning" if the
//     bypass expires at the menu). So we resume right after teardown instead.
// The bypass now RESUMES on a CONDITION, not this timer: FleeToMainMenu arms it with
// the menu's ui_menu_C::Tick as the release function, so the detour resumes the instant
// the menu world is up (teardown past) and re-injects MULTIPLAYER on that very frame --
// no fixed-timer window where the death-menu shows without MULTIPLAYER (the prior 15 s
// gap; a user who quit inside it never saw the button). This is only a SAFETY CEILING for
// the case where ui_menu_C::Tick never resolves/dispatches; kept generous so a slow
// teardown is never cut short. (If a death->rejoin black-screens/hangs, the menu tick

// coop/npc_sync.h -- Phase 5N1 NPC sync foundation.
//
// Engine-level interceptor on UGameplayStatics::BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass
// that:
//   - On HOST: optionally broadcasts EntitySpawn for allowlisted NPC classes
//     (gated by VOTVCOOP_NPC_SYNC=1 -- Inc2 ships the wire layer but the
//     client-side materializer is Inc3).
//   - On CLIENT: suppresses NPC spawns (allowlist matched by SuperStruct walk)
//     so only host-streamed NPCs exist on the client. Wire-received NPC
//     spawns bypass the suppressor via the MarkIncomingNpcSpawn slot.
//
// Idempotent install: Install() is called every NetPumpTick. The first call
// caches the session pointer + resolves the 12 NPC classes + the
// BeginDeferred UFunction. Once all are resolved the interceptor is set;
// further calls short-circuit.
//
// SPLIT (M-1 2026-05-29): the client-side receiver functions (OnEntitySpawn /
// OnEntityDestroy) live in `coop/npc_mirror.h` -- this file owns host-side
// PRE/POST/interceptor + resolution + lifecycle. The receivers consume the
// resolved UFunction refs through `npc_mirror::SetClientRefs(...)` (called
// once by Install when all refs become available) and access the shared
// allowlist + session pointer + bypass slot through the public accessors
// below.

// NPCs that spawned BEFORE it joined (the spawn-time EntitySpawn only reaches peers connected
// at spawn time). The client's existing npc_mirror::OnEntitySpawn path materializes each;
// MirrorManager::Install is idempotent so a re-send to an already-mirroring peer is a no-op.
// Reads each Element's bound actor for the current transform (skips elements whose actor is
// not yet bound). Net-pump connect edge. Game thread.

// HOST-only per-tick NPC pose stream driver: read each live Npc Element's current world
// transform + publish the batch to the session for the net thread to fan out (EntityPose,

// the host / when there are no NPCs. Call every net-pump tick. Game thread.

// on 2 clients). KNOWN FOLLOW-UP: the host POST observer (NpcSpawn_POST, which
// binds the actor into g_actorToNpcId for destroy-tracking) does NOT fire for a
// reflection-initiated BeginDeferred dispatch, even though the PRE interceptor
// on the same UFunction does -- so host-side NPC DESTROY-sync is not exercised
// by a dev-spawn. Root cause is in the ProcessEvent detour's post-observer
// dispatch (NOT the Inc2 ownership migration); needs FireObservers
// instrumentation. Spawn + mirror are unaffected.

// coop/npc_sync.h -- Phase 5N1 NPC sync foundation.
//
// Engine-level interceptor on UGameplayStatics::BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass
// that:
//   - On HOST: optionally broadcasts EntitySpawn for allowlisted NPC classes
//     (gated by VOTVCOOP_NPC_SYNC=1 -- Inc2 ships the wire layer but the
//     client-side materializer is Inc3).
//   - On CLIENT: suppresses NPC spawns (allowlist matched by SuperStruct walk)
//     so only host-streamed NPCs exist on the client. Wire-received NPC
//     spawns bypass the suppressor via the MarkIncomingNpcSpawn slot.
//
// Idempotent install: Install() is called every NetPumpTick. The first call
// caches the session pointer + resolves the 12 NPC classes + the
// BeginDeferred UFunction. Once all are resolved the interceptor is set;
// further calls short-circuit.
//
// SPLIT (M-1 2026-05-29): the client-side receiver functions (OnEntitySpawn /
// OnEntityDestroy) live in `coop/npc_mirror.h` -- this file owns host-side
// PRE/POST/interceptor + resolution + lifecycle. The receivers consume the
// resolved UFunction refs through `npc_mirror::SetClientRefs(...)` (called
// once by Install when all refs become available) and access the shared
// allowlist + session pointer + bypass slot through the public accessors
// below.

// the host lifecycle path may still be disabled (g_npcSyncDisabledThisProcess)
// without affecting that. On a BROKEN build (BeginDeferred UFunction / its
// params unresolvable) Install latches true with a NULL allowlist to stop
// retrying; IsInstalled() is then true with NOTHING resolved. That is safe for
// the only caller (the client reconcile sweep): IsAllowlistedClass returns
// false for unresolved slots, so the sweep classifies nothing and destroys
// nothing -- a benign no-op on a build where NPC sync is dead anyway. A caller
// MUST NOT gate broader world-ready logic on the interceptor being live
// (NPC-class load timing must never block prop/door replay). Used by net_pump
// to time the client-NPC reconcile sweep (npc_mirror::DestroyUntrackedClient-

// NPCs that spawned BEFORE it joined (the spawn-time EntitySpawn only reaches peers connected

// Why a newly-registered NPC's EntitySpawn carries savePersisted=1 (adopt a local twin) vs 0
// (fresh-spawn a mirror) depends on the CALLER's intent, NOT the actor's has-a-key property:
//  - ConnectEdge:        host world-load init (subsystems). The broadcast (re)reaches a JOINER who
//                        loaded the same save -> it MAY have a local twin of a keyed save object ->
//                        savePersisted = HasSaveKey(obj). [the v75 connect-edge adoption contract]
//  - MidSessionConverge: a kerfur turned ON mid-session (kerfur_convert). The broadcast reaches
//                        ALREADY-CONNECTED peers who have NO twin (they cancelled their own local
//                        turn-on) -> ALWAYS savePersisted=0 -> fresh-spawn now. A turn-on kerfur has
//                        a random UCS-minted key so HasSaveKey is true, but the key is meaningless to
//                        a peer that never loaded it -> routing it into the deferred adoption poll
//                        causes an ~8s pop-in + a class-only false-bind dupe (RCA 2026-06-15). This
//                        matches the runtime-interceptor send, which already hardcodes savePersisted=0
//                        for the same "spawned after the join, no local twin" reason.

// one-cb-per-UFunction observer table silently OVERWROTE npc_sync's slot. Commit
// eb3282d (multi-observer-per-UFunction, 2026-05-30 16:58 -- 4h after that note)
// gave each (target, cb) its own slot so both fire; the note was never re-checked

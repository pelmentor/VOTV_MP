// Engine-level interceptor on UGameplayStatics::BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass
// that:
//   - On HOST: optionally broadcasts EntitySpawn for allowlisted NPC classes
//     (gated by VOTVCOOP_NPC_SYNC=1 -- Inc2 ships the wire layer but the
//     client-side materializer is Inc3).
//   - On CLIENT: suppresses NPC spawns (allowlist matched by SuperStruct walk)
//     so only host-streamed NPCs exist on the client. Wire-received NPC
//     spawns bypass the suppressor via the MarkIncomingNpcSpawn slot.
//
// Idempotent install: Install() is called every NetPumpTick. The first call
// caches the session pointer + resolves the 12 NPC classes + the
// BeginDeferred UFunction. Once all are resolved the interceptor is set;
// further calls short-circuit.

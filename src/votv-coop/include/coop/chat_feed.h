// coop/chat_feed.h -- the coop event/chat line store (gameplay layer, principle 7).
//
// Replaces the old ue_wrap::hud_feed (a game-UMG screen-text widget) with a plain
// thread-safe DATA store: the coop layer Push()es event lines (joins, disconnects,
// later real chat); the RENDER-THREAD half (ui::hud) draws the last N lines in our
// ImGui overlay. Same game-thread-snapshot / render-thread-draw split as
// coop::roster -> ui::scoreboard. No engine/UObject access here -- pure data.
//
// Push()/Tick()/Reset() run on the GAME THREAD (the callers -- event_feed,
// player_handshake, the harness tick -- are all game-thread). GetSnapshot()/
// HasAny() are safe from any thread (the render thread reads them).

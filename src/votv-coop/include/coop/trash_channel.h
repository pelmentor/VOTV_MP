// coop/trash_channel.h -- the HOST-AUTHORITATIVE trash-entity sync-time-context (docs/piles/08).
//
// The pile-sync redesign's identity + freshness core. A trash entity is a host-minted eid that
// re-skins in place across pile -> clump -> pile (oldEid == newEid == E); POSITION IS NEVER IDENTITY,
// so a dense pile CLUSTER can never mis-bind (the v81 morph's proximity FindNearestChipPile false-fired
// on a neighbour -> the dupe; docs/piles/08 "Why 07 failed"). This module owns the per-eid MTA
// sync-time-context (`ctx`): the HOST bumps it on EVERY transition (grab / throw / land) and stamps it
// on every convert/carry/throw packet; RECEIVERS drop any packet whose ctx is older than the eid's
// known generation -- so a carry/land packet still in flight when the entity transitions can never be
// re-applied to the re-skinned entity (the one guard the morph lacked).
//
// MTA precedent: CElement::GenerateSyncTimeContext / CanUpdateSync (reference/mtasa-blue,
// CElement.cpp:1281/1300). Increment 1 (host-grab direction) is ctx-only; the PILED/HELD/FLYING state
// machine + the client GrabIntent/ThrowIntent handlers land with the client direction (v83). Principle
// 7: coop/ network layer. The clump<->pile link is driven from the VISIBLE seams (the InpActEvt_use PRE
// records a pending grab; the held-object edge adopts the clump) -- NOT the BeginDeferred spawn POST,
// which is EX_CallMath-dispatched and never reaches our ProcessEvent hook (2026-06-21 RE/hands-on).
// GAME-THREAD only (every entry point runs on the net-pump game thread).

// real land. DURING carry the host's stock churn -- the held clump re-piles on cluster contact ~1/s and the
// game auto-re-grabs (votv-chippile-carry-churn-...-2026-06-22) -- is SUPPRESSED: the re-pile (kToPile) is
// NOT broadcast and ctx is NOT bumped, so the client renders ONE clump (pose-streamed), not a pile stuck at
// the cluster re-skinned+teleported every cycle (the 2fps + non-disappearing-pile symptom, ONE root). The
// churn re-grab rebinds E onto the new clump (OnHostRegrab) so the carry stream stays alive. The REAL land
// is a re-pile NOT followed by a re-grab within kLandSettleTicks: the settle holds the ToPile broadcast that
// long; a re-grab CANCELS it (churn); the timeout COMMITS it (the one land) and closes the latch. Graceful:
// K too small -> a churn ToPile commits early, the re-grab re-opens -> a brief self-correcting
// clump->pile->clump flicker; K too large -> the land morph lags a few frames. Neither strands E. Per-eid.

// HOST: a garbage clump RE-ENTERED the hand during an active carry of E (the churn re-grab, observed at the
// held-object edge -- NOT a fresh player grab, so no pending grab). Rebind E onto `newClump` (the carry pose
// stream keeps tracking it) and CANCEL E's pending land-settle (a re-grab proves the preceding re-pile was
// churn, not the land). No broadcast, no ctx bump. No-op if E is not carrying. Game thread.

// edge uses this to tell a CHURN flicker (holding_actor empties right after a re-pile -> settle pending) from

// real release never coincides with one). Suppress the release edge only when carrying AND this is true. Game thread.

// coop/element/quiescence_drain.h -- the join-window ORDER owner.
//
// ONE concept, ONE owner: the drain-edge reconcile SEQUENCE that, at load-tail quiescence,
// reconciles divergent local-vs-authoritative element identity in a FIXED order. It holds
// every deferred queue armed during the join window and drains them in sequence; nothing
// else sequences this axis. [[feedback-one-owner-order-axis]]
//
// THE SEQUENCE (RunReconcile):
//   1. SweepReconcileSaveTimeTwins()                 -- retire a stale native chipPile@old (pile twin)
//   2. save_identity_bind::BindUnboundReCreates()    -- re-bind GC-churned unbound natives (identity layer; a
//                                                       distinct module the sequence CALLS, not absorbed)
//   3. kerfur_reconcile::SweepReconcileSaveTimeKerfurs() -- retire a stale kerfur off-prop (kerfur retire
//                                                       MECHANISM; another distinct module the sequence CALLS)
//   4. ApplyPendingSpawns()                          -- re-run a fresh-mirror spawn deferred out of the
//                                                       world-load episode (spawn-before-quiescence), AFTER the
//                                                       rebind (a late save twin resolves by exact key) and
//                                                       BEFORE the destroys (a spawn+destroy pair nets to zero)
//   5. ApplyPendingDestroys()                        -- apply a destroy that raced ahead of the bind
//                                                       (destroy-before-load), AFTER the rebind so it resolves
//   6. ApplyPendingPosCorrections()                  -- snap a window-moved save-pile to the host pos (b3)
//   7. (joinSweep only) LogCensus()                  -- the one-shot L1 orphan census
//
// TWO TRIGGERS, both at/after quiescence:
//   - the join-window quiescence sweep (join_membership_sweep::RunDivergenceSweep_, joinSweep=true), and
//   - a steady-state throttled tick (OnTick) -- fires whenever there is armed-but-unconsumed work past
//     load-tail quiescence (the D1 structural fix: a save-pile grabbed/moved AFTER the join one-shot, or a
//     kerfur turned on when no pile bracket armed, would otherwise leave a pending queue nothing drains).
//
// CAPTURE vs SEQUENCE: event handlers (remote_prop::OnDestroy, the PropSnapPos handler, pile_spawn_bind's
// twin miss, npc_mirror's kerfur EntitySpawn) only ARM the queues here -- they NEVER apply. This module is
// the SOLE place that applies, in order. A mutation that can't resolve now (target not loaded) stays queued
// and re-applies next drain -- NEVER dropped (that is the destroy-before-load / D1 bug class).
//
// What it does NOT own: the MEMBERSHIP doom sweep (destroy locals the host's snapshot didn't claim + the
// >50% valve) stays a join-window one-shot in remote_prop_spawn -- running it in steady state would wipe a
// legitimately-diverged world. Only the per-eid identity reconcile (bounded to armed work) is safe to run
// steadily, and that is what lives here.
//
// CONSOLIDATED 2026-06-30 (anti-smear refactor) from: coop/element/identity_reconcile.cpp (the SEQUENCE +
// trigger) + coop/props/pile_reconcile.cpp groups B+C (the deferred QUEUES it drained) -- two halves of one
// concept across two folders + the generic kerfur destroy queue in a "pile"-named file. The kerfur retire's
// SEQUENCING also moved here (it was a 3rd parallel order owner in kerfur_convert::PollKerfurConversions).
//
// Game-thread ONLY (both triggers run on the game thread). No mutex of its own.

// coop/save_identity_bind.h -- Phase 1 step 2b: CLIENT-side eid-range BIND of keyless save-loaded natives.
//
// THE GOAL (docs/COOP_STABLE_ID_SIDECAR.md S2.1/S3.6; mini-design phase1-eid-range-bind): give each keyless
// save-loaded native (chipPile | off-prop kerfur) a STABLE cross-peer identity = the HOST eid, keyed on the
// saveSlot ARRAY INDEX (Build 3, per-family). The host built + sent the {array-index -> host-eid} map (1B + 2a +
// Path A, VERIFIED: 874 entries arrive intact, in [objectsData(kerfur) -> primitivesData(chip)] array order).
// This step CONSUMES it: as the client's loadObjects/Load-Primitives replay the saved arrays (caught at the
// BeginDeferred thunk, 1A-proved to catch every keyless load-spawn), the k-th spawn OF EACH FAMILY is bound to
// that family's k-th map entry == that family's array index k. RE-proved (loadObjects bytecode): each replay
// loop is a synchronous in-loop for-loop, so the within-array spawn order == array index order; only the
// CROSS-array phase order varies run-to-run, which per-family cursors are immune to (a global ordinal was not).
//
// THE BIND (mini-design S3) is the SAME terminal operation the position-adopt path already ships
// (remote_prop_spawn.cpp:575/594): retire the native's peer-range LOCAL element, then RegisterPropMirror the
// native at the HOST eid -- a host-range MIRROR (principle 3: the native ACTOR is the local rendering of the
// host-authoritative entity). The ONLY difference is the TRIGGER: host eid + spawn-order, not a 30 cm
// position-match. Collision is closed by construction (mini-design S4): the peer eid is freed before the host
// eid is touched (disjoint ranges); an already-bound E (the rare "host PropSpawn beat the bind" race) is
// rebindInPlace'd + the redundant host-spawned actor echo-destroyed.
//
// FIRST MUTATING STEP: everything before this (1A/1B/S8.2/2a) was read-only / receive+log. This mutates the
// element registry. Gated [dev] save_identity_bind=1 (CLIENT ini); absent/0 = a cheap no-op (the 2a transport
// still logs the map, nothing binds). When Phase 1 is proven the gate is removed (RULE 2) and the bind becomes
// the shipping identity path that retires the position-adopt crutch (Phase 4).
//
// Game-thread only (the BeginDeferred thunk + RegisterPropMirror are GT). The received map is set from the
// save_transfer client completion (net thread) under a small mutex; the bind reads it on the GT.

// consumed -> it overflow-dropped = the 09:54/11:32 ghost). This walks live chipPile + off-kerfur natives that
// are NOT bound mirrors, and for each currently-UNBOUND host eid finds the re-create at its save-time position
// (the sidecar-v2 savePos, authoritative from the host) within 1cm + binds it -- order/count/timing-independent
// (no client-side eid->pos source exists; the host supplies it). Co-located (>1 within 1cm) -> ambiguous-skip.
// Bulk survivors (IsBoundMirrorNative) are skipped; bound eids are skipped (no double-bind). No-op when disabled
// / not armed / the map carries no positions (v1 peer). Game thread. Returns the count re-bound (for the log).

// currently-bound chipPile save-natives (Takes their mirror Element; the actor stays alive at its save
// position) right before the quiescence sweep -- so variant-1 then sees N unbound natives at save positions and
// re-binds them by the host-wire savePos. The verify: log shows `RE-BIND by position` N>0 binding the right

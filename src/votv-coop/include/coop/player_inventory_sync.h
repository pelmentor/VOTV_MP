// coop/player_inventory_sync.h -- per-player client inventory (host-persisted, GUID-keyed).
//
// Replaces the v56 whole-host-save inventory inheritance with a Minecraft-style per-player
// inventory persisted on the HOST at SaveGamesDir()/<save_name>/coop_players/<guid>.json,
// keyed by the client's durable GUID (harness::config::ReadPlayerGuid, carried in the Join).
//
// Plan: research/findings/votv-inventory-impl-plan-2026-06-14.md. Design (Topic 2):
// votv-wisp-and-client-inventory-RE-2026-06-12.md.
//
// INCREMENT 1 (this file's current scope): identity is wired (Join carries the GUID), and the
// HOST ensures each joining peer's per-save inventory FILE exists (an empty-inventory
// placeholder). No inventory DATA is read/serialized/applied yet -- that is Increment 2
// (serializer + read layer), Increment 3 (client->host stream + host persist), and Increment 4
// (host->client apply-on-join, gated behind an SP probe). Each increment is added here as it
// lands; this header grows with them (one feature per file, modular cap honored).

//   * CLIENT receiving from the HOST (slot 0): one chunk of the host's ON-JOIN apply blob (Inc 4,
//     host->client). Reassembles and, on completion, deserializes + stashes it as the pending
//     per-player inventory (HasPendingApply()), to be written into the save object by the

// the peer's GUID hasn't arrived. Returns true iff the blob was actually enqueued -- the caller

// (else the connect-edge refusal was never retried -> the client never got its inventory). Game thread.

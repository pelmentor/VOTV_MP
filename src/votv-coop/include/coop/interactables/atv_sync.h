// coop/atv_sync.h -- ATV/quadbike (AATV_C) Phase 1 body POSE sync (protocol v47).
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7): owns the wire protocol, the occupant-authority gating,
// the per-tick stream/poll, the receiver kinematic apply with a LerpWindow interp, the key->actor
// index, and the connect-snapshot. Talks to the engine ONLY through ue_wrap::atv.
//
// MODEL (RULE 1 / follow-MTA CUnoccupiedVehicleSync). The ATV is a save-placed, KEYED entity
// (Key@0x0618, cross-peer stable -- like the appliances/grime, NOT a runtime-spawned NPC), so it
// is synced as a keyed pose stream, NOT through the eid/Element/spawn machinery (that is YAGNI for
// one always-present keyed actor -- the same divergence the grime/window dirt sync made vs its
// element blueprint). OCCUPANT-AUTHORITATIVE single-syncer: the peer whose LOCAL player is seated
// (the driver) reads its live ATV root transform and throttled-streams it (~20Hz) reliably; the
// host RELAYS a client driver's pose to the other clients. A receiver applies it KINEMATICALLY
// (ue_wrap::atv::PrepareMirror disables the mirror's physics+tick so its own rig can't fight the
// stream) interpolated by a coop::LerpWindow, UNLESS it is itself the occupant (then it ignores --
// it is the authority, and re-enables its physics via ReleaseMirror so it can drive). Unoccupied
// ATVs are not streamed (they hold last pose); the host connect-snapshots each ATV's current pose
// (adopt=1) to a joiner.
//
// Phase 1 = body pose only. Phase 1.5 = occupant->puppet seating (occupantSlot is carried now).
// Phase 2 = fuel/health/brake on-change + the broken/explode discrete edge. Phase 1.5+ may move
// the transport to an UNRELIABLE newest-wins datagram (the blueprint's element path) if a lossy
// link makes the reliable ARQ lag the body -- on LAN/low-loss the reliable stream + interp is
// smooth. RE: research/findings/vehicles/votv-ATV-quadbike-RE-and-coop-sync-design-2026-06-08.md +

// coop/comms/peer_action_feed.h -- announce a peer's shared-world action to the
// local chat feed (gameplay layer, principle 7).
//
// The extensible home for "a player did a shared thing everyone should see". The
// first caller is email deletion (coop::email_sync): each peer renders the line
// LOCALLY from the existing EmailDelete wire event (which already carries who =
// senderSlot and which = content hash) -- no new packet. Each peer decides whether
// it SEES these lines via the ui.chat.peer_actions toggle (F1 > Cosmetics > Chat),
// default ON -- a local view preference, not a wire broadcast.
//
// Renders "<nick> <action>" with the nick colored per slot (chat_feed::PushChat).
// The subject is ALWAYS the actor's nickname -- the local actor sees the same
// "<OwnNick> <action>" line everyone else sees (the Minecraft feed principle,
// user 2026-07-18; the old "You <action>" rendering is retired, RULE 2).
// Announce()/AnnounceDirect()/SetEnabled() are GAME THREAD (the callers --
// email_sync's poll/apply, signal_catch, device_occupancy -- are game-thread).
// Enabled() is lock-free.

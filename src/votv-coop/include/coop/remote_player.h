// coop/remote_player.h -- the network-driven remote player.
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7). Parallel class hierarchy (principle 3):
// RemotePlayer owns the network/coop state and a POINTER to the engine entity it
// renders through. The engine actor's UClass is chosen at runtime by
// ue_wrap::puppet::IsMainPlayerPuppetKind:
//
//   * MainPlayer (default, 2026-05-25): a mainPlayer_C orphan spawned with
//     inertPawn=true. The class's built-in mesh_playerVisible carries the
//     player body skin + IK leg bones; per-screen systems (PostProcess +
//     mic + arms) are stripped at spawn, GameMode pointer nulled, CMC tick
//     disabled, actor tick disabled. The orphan's AnimBP is satellite-
//     driven (Plan B2) for the locomotion BlendSpace. IK legs work (real
//     Character has floor-trace context).
//
//   * SkelMesh (backup, env var VOTVCOOP_PUPPET_KIND=skelmesh): a bare
//     ASkeletalMeshActor wearing the local skin + body AnimBP, satellite-
//     driven for AnimBP. No IK legs (bare-actor has no floor-trace
//     context). RULE 2 retirement: this path goes when the MainPlayer
//     path is hands-on-verified working.
//
// Both paths: the engine actor owns rendering/animation; RemotePlayer owns
// the pose data. MTA shape: CClientPed::m_pPlayerPed -> CPlayerPed*.
//
// No marshaling/engine-memory access lives here; it all goes through ue_wrap.

// coop/remote_player.h -- the network-driven remote player.
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7). Parallel class hierarchy (principle 3):
// RemotePlayer owns the network/coop state and a POINTER to the engine entity it
// renders through -- a "skin-puppet": a bare ASkeletalMeshActor wearing the local
// player's exact skin (mesh_playerVisible) + the body AnimBP, which WE drive
// entirely (no pawn, no controller, no CharacterMovement). The engine actor owns
// rendering/animation; RemotePlayer owns the pose data. (MTA shape:
// CClientPed::m_pPlayerPed -> CPlayerPed*.)
//
// Why a puppet, not a 2nd mainPlayer_C: the protagonist class dragged its whole
// single-player tick surface along (the hijack/gamma cascade) and its AnimBP
// posed as a "stick" without a possessing controller. The puppet poses purely
// from AnimBP variables we set (root-cause finding, two converging agents) and
// has no hijack surface (RULE 1 root-cause; RULE 3 parallel hierarchy).
//
// No marshaling/engine-memory access lives here; it all goes through ue_wrap.

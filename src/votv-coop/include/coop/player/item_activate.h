// coop/item_activate.h -- unified item-activation sync (Phase 5F).
//
// First instance: flashlight on/off. Architecture per the RE doc
// (research/findings/inventory-items/votv-flashlight-RE-2026-05-25.md) -- Case b: the
// world light cone is mainPlayer_C::light_R, not a component on the
// flashlight item actor. The puppet (also a mainPlayer_C orphan) has
// the same light_R at the same offset; toggling its visibility is the
// full implementation.
//
// Sender path: ProcessEvent POST-observer on
// AmainPlayer_C::updateFlashlight -- reads `mp.flashlight @0x0838` +
// broadcasts ItemActivatePayload to peers. Echo-suppression flag keeps
// the receiver's apply from bouncing back.
//
// Receiver path: ApplyToPuppet writes puppet.flashlight @0x0838 +
// toggles puppet.light_R visibility via the existing
// engine::SetComponentVisible wrapper.
//
// [probe] flashlight_log=1 in votv-coop.ini adds extra log lines
// before+after every observed toggle so we can verify hands-on that
// the BP's early-return guard fires when !hasFlashlight, and that
// light_R.bVisible flips in lockstep with mp.flashlight. Default
// disabled.

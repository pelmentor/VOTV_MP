// coop/player/puppet_drive.h -- per-slot remote-player PUPPET lifecycle + drive.
//
// Extracted from coop/session/net_pump.cpp (2026-07-18; net_pump sat at 1237
// LOC with a 915-line Tick). Owns the g_puppets array (slot convention =
// coop::players::Registry: 0 = host, 1..kMaxPeers-1 = clients) and the whole
// per-tick puppet surface: spawn-on-first-pose (retry backoff, skins, cached
// nick, the join announce at the appearance seam), the pose/ragdoll drives,
// the per-puppet interp Tick, the wisp grab-hold choreography (it MOVES
// puppets -- drive concern), and the 1 Hz pose-diag emit. The bodies are
// verbatim from net_pump's old drive block; net_pump still owns the tick
// ORDER (it calls DriveTick inside its worldUp gate, then remote_prop).
// Game thread throughout (the moved GT asserts enforce it).

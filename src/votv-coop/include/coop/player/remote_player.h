// coop/remote_player.h -- the network-driven remote player.
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7). Parallel class hierarchy (principle 3):
// RemotePlayer owns the network/coop state and a POINTER to the engine entity
// it renders through. The engine actor is a `mainPlayer_C` orphan spawned with
// inertPawn=true; the class's built-in mesh_playerVisible carries the player
// body skin + IK leg bones. Per-screen systems (PostProcess + mic + arms) are
// stripped at spawn, GameMode pointer nulled, CMC tick disabled, actor tick
// disabled. The puppet's AnimBP reads its OWN CMC.Velocity + MovementMode
// natively for locomotion + IK (v2 anim drive, 2026-05-27): RemotePlayer::
// ApplyToEngine writes those CMC fields each tick from the streamed pose,
// exactly mirroring what the LOCAL player's possessed CMC does. IK legs
// work because the real Character has floor-trace context.
//
// The engine actor owns rendering/animation; RemotePlayer owns the pose data.
// MTA shape: CClientPed::m_pPlayerPed -> CPlayerPed*.
//
// No marshaling/engine-memory access lives here; it all goes through ue_wrap.

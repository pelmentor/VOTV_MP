// coop/props/native_pile_mirror.h -- materialize a host-authoritative trash PILE mirror as a ROOTED
// real actorChipPile_C native (replacing the bare AStaticMeshActor proxy for the pile form).
//
// WHY (2026-06-30, the proxy->native nativization): the bare proxy (coop/trash_proxy) can NEVER be the
// game's lookAtActor (no int_player_C) and has no collision -> no native hover GUI, no movement-block,
// no occlusion-correct aim, wrong rotation. The proxy existed only because a client-SPAWNED real pile
// died on its own within ~10s (the 2026-06-21 dup). An inertness probe (2026-06-30) PROVED that death
// was GC (unrooted): a runtime-spawned actorChipPile_C with the recipe below stayed live + inert (no
// self-destruct, no self-morph) for 60s WITH collision ON, and showed the native hover GUI on aim. So a
// rooted runtime native is a safe, fully-native mirror. [[lesson-runtime-staticmeshactor-must-be-movable]]
//
// A materialized native is BOUND + MARKED save-native (Element::SetSaveNative) so it rides the EXACT
// same proven machinery as a save-loaded bound native -- pose drive (ResolveLiveActorByEid), b3
// position-correction, the grab route (OnPileGrabPre reads lookAtActor + GrabIntent), the morph hand-off
// (OnConvert pile->clump), the divergence-sweep exemption, and retire. The CLUMP form stays a bare proxy
// (it has a LifeSpan + autonomous re-pile-on-contact -> too live to keep as a native).
//
// GAME-THREAD only.

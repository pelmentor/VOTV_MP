// coop/pile_reconcile.h -- the join-bracket keyless-pile position-bind reconcile.
//
// EXTRACTED from coop/remote_prop_spawn.cpp 2026-06-23 (RULE 2026-05-25 modular
// file-size: remote_prop_spawn.cpp had reached the 1500 LOC hard cap; this is the
// conceptually-distinct "reconcile the host's keyless chipPile expression against
// the client's save-loaded native pile set" subsystem). Behavior preserved
// byte-for-byte from the in-line implementation.
//
// WHY this subsystem exists: with the save-transfer join the client's world is
// LOADED FROM THE HOST'S OWN SAVE -- its chipPiles are the same piles, settled at
// the same positions. So the host's keyless-eid pile expression is reconciled
// against the client's OWN local pile (instead of sweep-destroying all ~870 and
// fresh-spawning mirrors). Two paths, both built off ONE lazily-built bracket-
// scoped GUObjectArray index (NOT one walk per pile):
//   - TryDestroyTwin: a host pile PROXY (AStaticMeshActor) spawned at `eid`; the
//     client's co-located save-loaded NATIVE twin is the visible DUP -> destroy it
//     so the proxy is the sole mirror. The match position is a PARAMETER: v86
//     Path 1c passes the pile's SAVE-TIME position (the frozen value both peers
//     loaded from the same save) so a pile the host MOVED in the join-load window
//     still reconciles (native@old vs the save-time key@old) -- pre-1c the match
//     was the proxy's CURRENT pose, which goes blind on a moved pile = the two-
//     channel join-window DUP (votv-pile-dup-join-window-two-channel finding).
//   - FindAndConsumeAdoptCandidate: the eid-only fresh-spawn fallback ADOPTS a
//     live same-class/chipType native within 30cm onto the host eid (the caller
//     registers the mirror + reconciles physics).
//
// Game-thread ONLY (the event_feed drain). No mutex -- same contract as the claim
// set it reads. The `claimed` set (remote_prop_spawn's g_claimedActors) is passed
// in read-only so an already-bound native is skipped.

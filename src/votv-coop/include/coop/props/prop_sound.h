// coop/prop_sound.h -- world-space prop interaction sounds for REMOTE
// players' grabs and throws (receiver-side synthesis).
//
// WHY (hands-on 2026-06-11 "object pick up / throw -- no sounds from puppet"
// + research/findings/player-puppet/votv-puppet-sounds-RE-2026-06-11.md): the native
// sounds run ONLY inside the local actor's input chain, so a remote peer
// never hears them:
//   E-GRAB CLICK (hands-on round 2, "always the same unique single sound"):
//     useAction plays the FIXED SoundWave `use` via PlaySound2D vol 0.25 /
//     pitch 1.0 right after pickupObject (@2181 + every successful E branch)
//     -- 2D, grabber-only. THE dominant grab feedback.
//   MATERIAL SOFT (the secondary grab-variant thud): the grabbed prop's
//     per-material "soft" cue (physSoundData.soft_30, lazily cached from the
//     lib_C::physSound DataTable) at the grab point, vol 0.5 / pitch 1.0 /
//     att_default (mainPlayer uber @100337) -- local input chain only.
//   THROW: the LMB throw plays SoundWave /Game/audio/effects/swing via
//     PlaySound2D vol 0.8 / pitch 1.05 (@16057 grabbed / @16826 held) --
//     2D + thrower-only BY NATIVE DESIGN (other players never hear a throw
//     even in principle). prop_C.thrown() is a no-op on the base class
//     (uber @465 POP->ret), so DrivePropThrown alone produces NO audio.
//
// The receiver therefore plays the SAME cooked cues at the synced edges
// (the flashlight-click shape -- MTA precedent: remote-entity sounds are
// the game's own cues played locally at synced events):
//   PlayGrabSound  -- GRAB-IN edge: the prop's own soft_30 cue at the prop.
//                     Null cue -> silent (native parity with the @100067
//                     DataTable row-miss gate). Non-Aprop_C (clump) -> silent.
//   PlayThrowWhoosh - GRAB-OUT edge past the throw speed gate: swing at the
//                     released prop, spatialized with att_default (an
//                     IMPROVEMENT over native 2D -- intentional, the whoosh
//                     is a "look at me" event).
//
// Supersedes coop/clump_throw_sound (RULE 2): that module played a GUESSED
// asset (object_throw) for the clump only; the byte-exact RE proves every
// LMB throw plays `swing` regardless of prop type, so ONE whoosh
// implementation covers Aprop_C and clumps alike.
//
// Game thread only (reflection + PlaySoundAtLocation).

// coop/remote_prop_spawn.h -- wire-driven PropSpawn receiver
// (extracted from coop/remote_prop.cpp M-1 2026-05-29 to bring that file
// under the 800-LOC soft cap; was 1028 LOC).
//
// Owns the OnSpawn pipeline that materializes a wire-received Prop on
// the receiver side:
//   1. Validate wire payload (class + key non-empty, key != "None").
//   2. EXACT-KEY DEDUP -- if a local Aprop_C derivative with the same
//      Key already exists, converge transform + (if collision-restore
//      class) restore collision + register mirror Element. Skip the
//      convergence write when the local actor is already under active
//      PropPose drive (the stream owns position while held).
//   3. FUZZY-POSITION DEDUP (Gap-I-1) -- if no exact-key match, look
//      for a same-class actor within 30 cm of the wire transform; if
//      found, converge transform + rekey via Aprop_C.setKey + restore
//      collision + register mirror. Drive-skip applies the same way.
//   4. FRESH SPAWN -- BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass + setKey BEFORE
//      FinishSpawningActor (so Aprop_C.Init() doesn't overwrite Key
//      with NewGuid) + FinishSpawningActor + optional initial physics
//      (SetSimulatePhysics + linear velocity).
//   5. Register the resulting actor as a Prop mirror at sender's eid.
//
// Cross-TU API to coop::remote_prop:
//   - remote_prop::IsActorUnderAnyDrive(actor) -- drive-cache predicate
//   - remote_prop::RegisterPropMirror(eid, actor, key, cls)
//   - remote_prop::KeyToWString(wireKey)
//
// NO echo loop: this path spawns via engine::SpawnActor (deferred-spawn
// pair) NOT through UpropInventory_C.takeObj, so the takeObj POST
// observer (the sender hook) never fires.

// Called from event_feed when a PropSpawn reliable message arrives.
// Game-thread only (UFunction calls are GT-only). event_feed posts
// via game_thread::Post to satisfy this. `senderSlot` is the reliable
// header's senderPeerSlot (host-relay logical origin) -- tagged onto the
// mirror for per-slot disconnect eviction (D1-7). `localPlayer` (the live
// AmainPlayer_C*, may be null) feeds the local-held guard: a prop the LOCAL
// player is grabbing is claimed + mirror-bound but never physics-reconciled
// or teleport-converged (Fork B 2d -- a re-bracket re-expresses held props).
// `fromConvert` (remote_prop::OnConvert's synthesized pile spawn only)
// disables the keyless-pile position-bind lane: a convert-born pile has no
// local counterpart by construction, so it must never bind to a nearby
// unrelated pile -- it always fresh-spawns. Wire dispatch passes the default.
// `deferKerfur` (K-6, default true for the wire dispatch): for a prop-form kerfur whose local twin
// isn't found by the inline fuzzy match, DEFER to the polled class+pose adoption
// (kerfur_prop_adoption::Arm) instead of fresh-spawning a duplicate beside the still-async-loading
// twin. Passed false by the adoption's own quiescence fresh-spawn fallback (one-shot, no defer loop)
// and by kerfur_convert::MaterializeKerfurMirror's convert materialize (the parked ghost is ready now).
//
// `outSpawned` / `skipBind` (v81 MORPH V2, remote_prop::OnConvert only): when `skipBind` is true,
// OnSpawn does NOT bind the freshly-spawned actor to `payload.elementId` (it skips the final
// RegisterPropMirror + IndexActorKey) and instead returns the actor via `*outSpawned`. The bind-model
// morph re-skins the SAME eid E in place, and the rebind path differs for a LOCAL element (host's own
// pile -> RebindLocalElementActor) vs a MIRROR (a bystander's adopted pile -> RegisterPropMirror
// rebindInPlace), so OnConvert binds explicitly. `fromConvert` ALSO skips the eid-dedup so a convert
// always fresh-spawns the new rendering of E (the still-live old rendering of E must NOT converge it).

// ---- Adoption-universe claim tracking (P2 2026-06-10; widened Fork B 2e) --
//
// The client boots a FRESH New Game world and ADOPTS the host's prop world
// at every snapshot bracket. Contract: SWEEP == EXPRESS + CLIENT-FORBIDDEN.
// During the bracket, OnSpawn binds every host-expressed prop to a client
// actor (exact-key match, fuzzy match, eid match, or fresh spawn) -- each
// bind is a CLAIM; the SELF-announce broadcast sites claim their own actors
// too (RecordClaimIfTracking -- an entity expressed on the wire in EITHER
// direction is accounted for). At SnapshotComplete every still-live UNCLAIMED
// actor in the expressible universe -- keyed IsClassKeyedInteractable actors
// + the keyless chipPile lineage (eid-expressed by the host snapshot) -- is a
// local the host's world does not have: destroyed (echo-suppressed,
// OnDestroy-parity teardown) so the client adopts the host world. Keyless
// NON-pile actors (held clumps mid-flight, pre-Init Aprop_C, event clumps)
// are NOT expressible and never swept. The wire-suppressed mushroom7
// intermediate is keyed-in-universe but never expressed -> swept: parity
// with the client's connected-state destroy-on-sight.
//
// Protections by construction: baked-key placed props bind exact-key;
// unmoved runtime-keyed props bind fuzzy; wire fresh-spawns claim pre-
// Finish; locally-held props claim + skip reconcile (2d). A prop the host
// destroyed/no longer has is correctly swept -- that IS the adoption.
//
// Ordering is drain-order-safe: SnapshotBegin -> PropSpawn* -> SnapshotComplete
// arrive on one reliable lane and are dispatched INLINE on the game thread by
// the event_feed drain, so all claims strictly precede the sweep. The bracket
// is unicast to the joining peer (prop_snapshot SendReliableToSlot), so an
// already-connected peer never arms tracking nor sweeps. The host side only
// opens a bracket when its registry expresses its CURRENT world (the fork-A
// coherence gate) -- a mid-transition near-empty bracket can no longer reach
// the sweep.

// Arm claim tracking (clears any prior claim set). Called from the client's
// SnapshotBegin handler. Game-thread only.
void BeginClaimTracking();

// Public claim primitive for the SELF-announce broadcast sites (Init POST /
// takeObj POST / held-item / convert): a client announcing a prop while a
// bracket is open creates a live in-universe actor the host's already-
// enumerated bracket cannot express -- claim it or the sweep destroys the
// announcer's own prop while the host keeps the mirror. No-op when tracking
// is disarmed (one bool read). Game-thread only.
void RecordClaimIfTracking(void* actor);

// Arm the deferred divergence sweep. Called from the client's SnapshotComplete
// handler INSTEAD of sweeping inline. The inline sweep was wrong: a save-loaded-
// but-host-converted-away prop (the kerfur turned ON by the host before this
// client joined) has its Aprop_Key restored on a LATE loadData tail that
// finishes AFTER SnapshotComplete, so an inline sweep read Key=None, hit the
// keyless-skip, and let it survive as a keyed untracked ghost (the
// save-transfer kerfur dupe). Arming defers the one real sweep to
// TickClientReconcile, which fires it only once the load tail has quiesced (the
// keyless in-universe population is stable) or an 8 s hard deadline elapses.
// Claim tracking STAYS armed until the sweep runs, so a host PropSpawn (or a
// client self-announce) arriving during the quiesce window still claims its
// actor and is not swept. No-op (with a WARN) if tracking was never armed.
// Game-thread only. (Mirrors npc_adoption::OnSnapshotComplete + Tick's
// convergence gate -- the proven v75 NPC-side shape, now on the prop channel.)

// Per-client-tick driver for the deferred sweep. NO-OP (single bool read) when
// no sweep is armed -- zero steady-state cost. While armed, a throttled 5 Hz
// quiescence probe counts keyless in-universe unclaimed actors; when that count
// is stable across a few scans (load tail drained -> every survivor has its
// final key) OR the hard deadline fires, it runs the one real sweep and
// disarms. Called from npc_mirror::TickClientNpcs (client-only). Game-thread only.

// The divergence-universe membership test WITHOUT the "a sweep is pending" precondition: `actor`

// -- a save-loaded local awaiting adjudication against the host snapshot, regardless of whether the
// sweep has armed yet. trash_collect_sync uses this (gated on !HasLoadTailQuiesced) to refuse to
// broadcast such a prop grabbed in the WHOLE pre-quiescence join window, not just while a sweep is
// actively pending (the 2026-06-16 off+grab dupe: a grab BEFORE the bracket armed slipped past
// IsPendingSweepCandidate and fresh-spawned a permanent host duplicate). Game-thread only.
bool IsInDivergenceUniverseUnclaimed(void* actor);

// True while a deferred sweep is pending AND `actor` is one of its candidates (=
// IsInDivergenceUniverseUnclaimed while g_sweepPending): an in-universe (keyed-interactable Aprop),
// live, UNCLAIMED local prop the host did NOT express -- a divergent ghost awaiting adjudication
// (e.g. the save-transfer kerfur the host turned ON before this client joined, which the
// client's stale save still has as an OFF prop). The client held-prop broadcast
// (trash_collect_sync::EnsureHeldItemBroadcast) calls this to REFUSE to re-announce
// such a ghost when the player grabs it in the pre-sweep window: a PropSpawn would
// fresh-spawn a host duplicate AND a claim would rescue the ghost past the pending
// sweep (permanently). A genuinely client-originated drop is claimed via the takeObj
// path, so it is NOT a candidate here and streams normally. chipPile lineage is
// excluded (it has its own pre-existing collect/share + death-watch path).

bool IsPendingSweepCandidate(void* actor);

// True once the deferred divergence sweep has FIRED for the current connect
// bracket -- i.e. the save load's late key-minting tail has drained (or the hard
// deadline elapsed). npc_adoption uses this to fresh-spawn a save-persisted NPC
// mirror that has NO local twin AS SOON AS the load is done (the kerfur the host
// turned ON before this client joined: the stale save has no NPC to adopt, and
// once the load tail is drained none will ever appear), instead of waiting its own
// fixed 8 s fallback timeout. Reset on each new bracket / world / disconnect.

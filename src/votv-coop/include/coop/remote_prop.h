// coop/remote_prop.h -- receiver-side held-prop driver (v4 wire, Stage 4).
//
// Mirrors RemotePlayer in shape but for physics-prop grab replication:
//   * On the FIRST PropPose for a new Key, look up the local Aprop_C* by
//     string match over GUObjectArray (prop_wrap::FindByKeyString), call
//     SetSimulatePhysics(false) on its StaticMesh so PhysX stops simulating
//     it, and cache the pointer for the grab duration.
//   * Per subsequent PropPose: SetActorLocation + SetActorRotation on the
//     cached actor.
//   * On PropRelease (or a >500 ms PropPose gap, treated as implicit
//     release): SetSimulatePhysics(true) + AddImpulse if the impulse vector
//     is non-zero (throw), clear the cache.
//
// Methodology-wise this matches MTA's ucSyncTimeContext-style ownership
// transfer: the sender (host) is authoritative for the held prop; the
// receiver kinematically displays it. When the host releases, the prop's
// physics resumes on every peer independently (same world state because
// Aprop_C.heavy / .Static etc. are content-driven, identical cross-peer).

// the cached pointer so the next PropPose has to re-resolve.
//
// `localPlayer` is passed so `prop.thrown` has a non-null Player param
// (the BP may null-check). Caller supplies the LOCAL mainPlayer_C ptr;
// the BP's "throw stats" attribution will credit local (semantically a

// at the wire transform, dispatches Aprop_C.setKey(receivedKey) BEFORE
// FinishSpawningActor (so Aprop_C.Init() doesn't overwrite Key with
// NewGuid), then FinishSpawningActor, then SetSimulatePhysics + optional
// initial velocity. Result: a matching local Aprop_X_C instance with
// the same Key. Subsequent PropPose updates resolve via the existing
// prop_wrap::FindByKeyString path.
//
// NO echo loop: receiver spawns directly through engine::SpawnActor (the
// deferred-spawn pair), NOT through UpropInventory_C.takeObj, so the
// takeObj POST observer (which is the sender hook) never fires.

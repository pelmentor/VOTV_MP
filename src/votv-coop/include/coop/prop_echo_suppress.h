// coop/prop_echo_suppress.h -- one-shot echo-suppression sets used by the
// host/client prop_lifecycle observers to skip broadcasting a spawn/destroy
// that originated from the OTHER end of the wire (the receiver-side OnSpawn
// / OnDestroy in coop::remote_prop calls Mark*; the symmetric observer in
// coop::prop_lifecycle calls Consume*).
//
// Without this, our own receiver-applied spawn/destroy would re-broadcast
// to the original sender = packet ping-pong.
//
// Extracted from coop/remote_prop.h (audit closeout PR-4.10): these are
// implementation details shared by exactly two TUs (prop_lifecycle and
// remote_prop) and were leaking into remote_prop's public API. Both TUs
// now include this header; remote_prop's public surface no longer exposes
// them.
//
// Game-thread-only access. Set capacity is bounded internally; on overflow
// the set is cleared (a one-shot stale lookup on a never-consumed entry
// is harmless -- it lets a wire-induced spawn re-broadcast once, which
// the OTHER side de-dupes via FindByKeyString).

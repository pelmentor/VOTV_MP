// coop/weather_fog.h -- Phase 5W host-authoritative FOG sync (2026-06-01).
//
// Hands-on bug 2026-06-01: the CLIENT showed STRONG MIST while the HOST was
// CLEAR. RE (4-agent IDA+dump workflow) + a solo runtime probe (mp.py fogprobe)
// established WHY the prior weather_sync fog handling failed and what the fix is:
//
//   - enable_fog / enable_superfog are persistent CONFIG gates ("rolls allowed"),
//     NOT active-state toggles. The ACTIVE fog is an event ACTOR:
//       * rolling fog = AweatherFogController_C, held in cycle->fogEventObject@0x338
//       * super fog   = a live AsuperFog_C (no storage slot; found by class)
//     Each actor self-drives its OWN ReceiveTick, ramping the height-fog density
//     (finalFogDensity@0x418) up over its Duration, then self-destructs.
//   - The base ambient density (~0.04) is SHARED between peers (ToD-driven,
//     identical un-suppressed ReceiveTick). The probe proved a cleared client
//     settles to that same ambient. So host-clear -> client-clear needs ONLY
//     actor destruction; there is NO need to stream a density float.
//   - ApplyFromHost previously only flipped the enable_* bits, so a fog actor the
//     client spawned (pre-connect, or in the Install latch window where spawnFog
//     wasn't even intercepted) rode out its own Duration while the host was clear.
//
// Architecture (assert the host's actor presence -- MTA CBlendedWeather::DoPulse):
//   WIRE: WeatherStatePayload::flags2 carries kFogActive / kSuperFogActive /
//         kPermanentFog (the host's live-actor presence + gamerule).
//   HOST: ReadHostFogState stamps flags2 from the live cycle. The rolling actor
//         self-destructs on Duration with NO observed UFunction firing, so the
//         scheduler POST observers MISS the fog-END; HostFogStateChanged is a
//         throttled per-tick detector that returns true on a fog-bit edge so
//         weather_sync re-broadcasts.
//   CLIENT: suppresses spawnFog (so it can never make uncommanded fog) via an
//         echo-suppressed PRE interceptor, and ApplyFromHost asserts the host's
//         state -- destroy a stray rolling actor on host-clear; echo-suppressed
//         spawnFog to mirror on host-fog (the client's own actor ramps naturally,
//         like the lightning-strike spawn-on-command pattern); destroy any stray
//         super fog on host-clear.
//
// Super-fog SPAWN (host-super -> client-super) is DEFERRED in v1 (clear-only):
// AsuperFog_C owns a UFO encounter (AHoelUfo_C) and its spawn was not reliably
// reproducible in the probe. Documented follow-up.
//
// P7: this module owns the fog engine substrate (offsets + UFunction thunks);
// weather_sync (gameplay/network) drives it. Mirrors weather_lightning/weather_redsky.

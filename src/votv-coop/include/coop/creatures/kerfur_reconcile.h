// coop/kerfur_reconcile.h -- the join-window kerfur off->active dup RETIRE (scope A, 2026-06-24).
//
// THE forward off->active dup root (census-pinned 2026-06-24, docs/kerfur/03 + 07): a kerfur that was
// OFF in the transferred save but the host turns ON in the join-load window. The host no longer expresses
// it as an off-prop (it is now an active NPC on the npc channel), so the joining client's OWN save-loaded
// local off-prop is never adopted/claimed as a host mirror -- it SURVIVES beside the active NPC (the dup,
// census 15:43 + 16:37: an UNCLAIMED prop_kerfurOmega_C). The divergence sweep does NOT retire it. So we
// retire it explicitly.
//
// TRIGGER: the retire is armed from the kerfur's npc EntitySpawn (npc_mirror::OnEntitySpawn reads
// payload.retireOffEid), NOT the KerfurConvert. A join-window turn-on's KerfurConvert SendReliable is
// pre-world-gated mid save-transfer (v56 B2 invariant -- host log 16:37:10 + 13:21:20:54), so the convert
// never reaches the joiner; the active form rides the npc EntitySpawn instead (which DOES reach it). The
// host stamps the off-prop's HOST EID onto that EntitySpawn (kerfur_entity::GetOriginOffEidForEid, sourced
// from BindFormActor's KerfurRecord.originOffEid = the off-prop's save eid).
//
// v91 DETERMINISTIC (replaces the position-fuzzy 1cm match): the joiner already binds its save-loaded
// off-prop to that SAME host eid via save_identity_bind (Build 3 ordinal bind), so the off-prop is a Prop
// MIRROR at retireOffEid. The retire is a direct MirrorManager<Prop>::Get(retireOffEid) lookup + teardown --
// no GUObjectArray walk, no fuzzy 1cm position match, no collision class. The off-prop may not have
// async-loaded/bound yet when the EntitySpawn arrives, so the retire runs at QUIESCENCE (the sweep below,
// driven by kerfur_convert::PollKerfurConversions) and a pending eid not yet bound is KEPT for the next
// sweep (never dropped early -> no duplicate-survives risk).
//
// CLIENT-only. Game-thread only (the EntitySpawn apply + the quiescence sweep both run on the GT drain).

// coop/wisp_tear_mirror.h -- Killer Wisp coop, RECEIVER side (Inc2, parts B + C).
//
// See research/findings/npc-creatures/votv-killerwisp-coop-design-2026-06-13.md. The HOST detect +
// route lives in coop/wisp_attack_sync; this module owns the two receiver paths:
//
//   * OnWispGrab (the VICTIM only): the host's killerwisp grabbed THIS client's puppet
//     and neutralized its own false-grab; this client now dies for real. Per-peer-
//     authoritative kill: schedule ragdollMode(true,false,true) on our OWN possessed
//     player after the host's fixed delay (NOT a montage notify -- our wisp mirror is a
//     kinematic puppet that fires no notifies). Native ragdoll death -> menu -> rejoin.
//
//   * OnWispTear (ALL peers + the host's own local call): play the fatality TEAR on the
//     LOCAL wisp mirror -- force its parked mesh to tick + Montage_Play 'fatality' (the
//     mirror never runs the BP montage itself). PlayTearOnWisp is the shared core (the
//     host calls it directly on its own wisp actor since it doesn't receive its own
//     WispTear broadcast).
//
// DEFERRED to a follow-on (documented, no stubs): the 4 limb gibs + blood particles, the
// victim socket-attach hold ('playerGrab' + a RemotePlayer wisp-held display mode), and
// the victim CMC park. The first version is the cross-peer KILL + the wisp tear animation.

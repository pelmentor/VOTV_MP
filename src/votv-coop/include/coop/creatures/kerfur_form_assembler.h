// coop/creatures/kerfur_form_assembler.h -- the kerfur FORM-FLIP assembler:
// first consumer of the EX_Local* VM-dispatch substrate (ue_wrap/vm_dispatch).
//
// docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md S3. The kerfur turn-on / turn-off conversion
// verbs (spawnKerfuro / dropKerfurProp) are BP-internal EX_LocalVirtualFunction
// self-calls -- invisible to both ProcessEvent and Func patches -- which forced
// three probabilistic fragment-stitching crutches (fresh-spawn stamps, destroy-
// edge capture, death-watch poll; takes 8/9/10, take-10 regressed). The substrate
// gives us a DETERMINISTIC bracket at the verb itself; this module will grow into
// the capture + destroy-suppress + deferred-converge assembler that retires those
// crutches (increments 2a-2c).
//
// INCREMENT 1 (observe-only, retained): register the two verbs with the substrate
// and, on each caught dispatch, LOG the Context class + depth + the 2a-observe gate
// counters. This proved the PERMANENT substrate delivers the catch end-to-end and
// turned the inferred kerfur variant family into a MEASURED set (G1 13:40 take:
// formIn/selfIn in-window, DESTROY_NO_SPAWN=0, Bindex live).
//
// INCREMENT 2a-CAPTURE (2026-07-14, this file now feeds behavior): on each in-bracket
// (0x45) OR in-request-scope (CallFunction) kerfur-form successor spawn, STORE the
// finished actor B (pointer + live index + form) in a one-shot thread-local slot. The
// convert layer (coop::kerfur_convert) CONSUMES it at the paired A-destroy edge --
// TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy (client relay-suppress / host inline converge) and
// ConvergeAfterConversion (request route) -- to bypass the (0,0,0) post-destroy
// proximity anchor that starved the guard on every real toggle (take-8/take-10
// misfilter class; measured live in the G1 take). The capture is the DETERMINISTIC
// which-B; the converge/suppress logic itself is unchanged and still lives in
// kerfur_convert. Still NO suppress/converge IN THIS FILE (2b/2c own routing) -- the
// verb bodies run unchanged; this module only publishes B.
//
// Logging is gated behind [dev] vm_dispatch_log (default off) and capped, so a
// normal session is silent and a hands-on observation run is not spammed. The capture
// STORE + the observe counters accrue whenever the session is active (behind neither
// gate) so a run can never end having captured/measured nothing.

// coop/piramid_sync.h -- the walking-pyramid (piramid2_C) event mirror lane.
//
// Ground truth: research/findings/props-lifecycle/votv-piramid2-RE-2026-07-04.md; design: docs/events/piramid.md.
// The pyramid rides the GENERIC rails for four of its five axes -- spawn/pose/despawn =
// world_actor_sync (piramid2_C on kWorldActorAllowlist), the 4 killerwisps + their deaths =
// npc lane, event identity = event_fire_sync verdict ('piramid' no-replay), registry parity =
// the mirror's own native BeginPlay/Destroyed setEvent(true/false). This lane owns ONLY the
// one axis no generic rail carries: the pyramid's BRAIN (host-random AI) and the GATHER
// choreography relay. It is the second event-specific choreography lane (killerwisp-vs-peers
// was the first); a shared "brainy event actor" helper gets extracted when a third lane
// proves the common shape ([[feedback-fix-then-generalize-mirror-identity]]).
//
//  - CLIENT brain suppression: PRE-cancel the mirror's FOUR STATE-WRITING timer handlers
//    (seeWisps / checkIfReached / randLoc -- every walkTo caller -- plus changeLook, the
//    1 Hz RANDOM head-wander re-roll; v102 reclassified it from "per-viewer cosmetic" to a
//    streamed axis after the user saw the heads/searchlight diverge live 2026-07-05).
//    ReceiveTick stays ALIVE (deliberate divergence from the design doc's tick-off sketch,
//    per RE section 5: the per-tick gather-beam params, head look-at and hover-Z smoothing
//    all live in the tick and are pure derivations of mirrored state; march/turn are
//    structurally zero because isWalking/multiplyWalk can never latch once the walkTo
//    callers are cancelled). The 30 s ping stays alive -- per-viewer cosmetic by RE verdict.
//  - HOST gather detect: POST observer on checkIfReached (timer-fired -> ProcessEvent-
//    VISIBLE) edge-detects `gathering` false->true and relays PyramidGather{pyramidEid,
//    wispEid} (WorldActor eid + Npc eid -- the two lanes' own identities).
//  - CLIENT gather replay: stage the native inputs the host had at ITS commit (wispTarget +
//    isWalking, staged only once the mirrors interp within the native 10000-unit arrive
//    radius) and re-dispatch checkIfReached through a TLS allow slot -- the game's OWN
//    bytecode then runs the entire choreography (montage + proxy delegate binds + notifies +
//    beams + timelines + wisp freeze). Nothing is reimplemented. The 'del' notify's local
//    wisp destroy CONVERGES with the npc lane's authoritative EntityDestroy (a client mirror
//    is never in npc_sync's host reverse map -> no echo; whichever lands second sees
//    "already not-live" and no-ops).

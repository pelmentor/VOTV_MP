// coop/ban_list.h -- persistent host-side IP banlist (Phase 2 moderation).
//
// MTA precedent: CBanManager / CBan (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/
// deathmatch/logic/CBanManager.{h,cpp} + CBan.h). MTA keys bans by IP +
// serial + nick and persists them to banlist.xml; the join-time check
// (CGame.cpp:1956/1973, inside Packet_PlayerJoinData) rejects a banned
// IP/serial before the player spawns. We follow the same SHAPE, trimmed to
// what our model has: there are no hardware serials in the GNS LAN-direct
// topology, so we key by IP only. The nick + ban time are stored for the
// admin's reference (display / file readability), not for matching.
//
// Persistence: a plain line-based text file (one ban per line:
//   ip|nick|unixtime|reason
// ) named votv-coop-banlist.txt, written NEXT TO THE MOD BINARY (the
// Binaries\Win64 dir that holds votv-coop.dll / votv-coop.ini / votv-coop.log,
// resolved via our own module handle). Each game copy keeps its own banlist;
// survives host restarts (the locked decision: BAN is permanent). HOST-ONLY --
// a client never accepts incoming connections, so the banlist is meaningless
// off-host and is simply never loaded there.
//
// Thread model: Load() runs once at host session start (boot thread, before
// the net thread spawns). IsBanned() is read on the NET thread (the GNS
// accept callback's filter). Add() is called on the GAME thread (an admin
// click marshalled via GT::Post in coop::moderation). All three serialize on
// one internal mutex; the in-memory set is the source of truth at runtime and
// the file is rewritten on every Add so a crash can't lose a just-applied ban.

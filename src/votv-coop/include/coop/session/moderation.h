// coop/moderation.h -- host-side player-admin actions (player-list action menu).
//
// The host's interactive scoreboard (ui::scoreboard) calls these when the
// host clicks a player row. This module is the single entry point for the three
// actions: KICK + BAN are always available to the host; TELEPORT-TO-ME is the
// dev-gated one (the scoreboard only shows it when [dev] devkeys is on -- this
// module doesn't re-check the dev flag, it just performs the teleport).
//
// All three are HOST-only and self-gate on Session::Role::Host (defense in
// depth -- the scoreboard already only renders actions for the host, but a
// destructive kick/ban must never run off a client even if a future caller
// misuses it). Each action marshals onto the game thread (GT::Post) so the
// scoreboard's render-thread click does no net/disk work inline, and so the
// nick lookup (player_handshake::NicknameForSlot, game-thread-asserted) is legal.
//
// principle-7: this is gameplay/policy orchestration (coop/), wiring the net
// mechanism (Session::Kick / GetPeerAddress), the persistence policy
// (coop::ban_list), and the existing teleport feature together. The net layer
// stays policy-free -- it learns about bans only through the injected accept
// filter (Session::SetAcceptFilter), never by calling this module.
//
// MTA precedent: CStaticFunctionDefinitions::KickPlayer / BanPlayer ->
// CGame::QuitPlayer (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/.../CStaticFunctionDefinitions
// .cpp:11876 / :11924). MTA's BanPlayer adds the ban THEN kicks the matching
// live player -- BanSlot below does the same (capture IP -> add ban -> kick).

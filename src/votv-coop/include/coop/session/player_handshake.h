// coop/player_handshake.h -- Player-Element mirror exchange (Join + AssignPeerSlot).
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7). Extracted from event_feed.cpp on
// 2026-05-29 (C5) to keep event_feed below the 800 LOC soft cap after the
// A4 v13 wire migration pushed it to 841 LOC. The handshake is its own
// subsystem: it owns the local + per-slot nickname state, the per-slot
// Join-sent latch, and the two reliable kinds (Join, AssignPeerSlot) that
// carry the mirror Element ids between peers.
//
// Mirror exchange model (A4 / v13):
//   - Host -> Client (AssignPeerSlot): host stamps its local Player
//     Element id (hostElementId) when issuing the slot assignment.
//     Client EstablishMirrorForSlot(0, hostElementId).
//   - Peer -> Peer (Join): each peer's Join payload prepends its own
//     senderElementId (uint32). Receiver EstablishMirrorForSlot(
//     senderPeerSlot, senderElementId).
//   - Result: both peers' element::Registry agree on the same id for
//     each Player Element.
//
// State ownership split with event_feed:
//   - player_handshake owns: g_localNick, g_remoteNickBySlot, g_joinSentBySlot.
//   - event_feed owns: g_lastConnectedBySlot (connect/disconnect edge
//     detector for the "<X> left the game" feed message).
//   - On a per-slot disconnect, event_feed calls NicknameForSlot for the
//     hud message and OnSlotDisconnected to reset our Join-sent latch so
//     a reconnect re-announces.
//
// Game thread only (it reads/writes UE engine objects via Puppet().SetNickname,
// chat_feed::Push, players::Registry, and reads our process-local cfg).

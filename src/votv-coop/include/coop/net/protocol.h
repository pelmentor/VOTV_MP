// coop/net/protocol.h -- the wire format (Phase 3, serialization layer).

// Methodology 3.3: this sits ABOVE the pure-I/O transport and BELOW the session
// application layer. It is just POD structs + (de)serialization; it knows nothing
// about sockets and nothing about the engine. Layout is fixed, packed, and
// little-endian (LAN-first: both peers are x86-64 Windows, so we send the structs
// raw -- no endian swap needed; the magic+version guard a future mismatch).

// (x,y,z,yaw,speed). Input/equipment/entity packets (Phase 4) get new MsgTypes.

// (research/findings/votv-throw-release-pipeline-RE-2026-05-24.md) showed the

// on ReleaseComponent the body re-enters dynamic sim INHERITING that velocity.

// inherited velocity entirely (Bug B). Capture is via
// UPrimitiveComponent.GetPhysicsLinearVelocity / GetPhysicsAngularVelocityInDegrees
// on the release edge; apply via the matching Set... pair after
// SetSimulatePhysics(true).
// v4 (2026-05-24): physics-object grab replication added.
//   - MsgType::PropPose = per-frame world transform of the prop the sender
//     currently holds (unreliable; receiver lookup-by-Key on first arrival,
//     SetSimulatePhysics(false) + drive transform per packet)
//   - ReliableKind::PropRelease = one-shot release signal; v5 carries inherited
//     linear+angular velocity (replaces v4's throw-impulse FVector); receiver
//     re-enables SimulatePhysics + SetPhysicsLinearVelocity + SetPhysicsAngularVelocityInDegrees
//   - WireKey carries the FName string (cross-peer stable, idx is NOT --
//     see research/findings/votv-physics-interaction-deep-re-2026-05-23.md)
// v9 (2026-05-27 Phase 5G Inc 2): NonPropEntityState/Destroy packets shipped
// then retired the same day -- chipPile/clump/trashBitsPile families ride
// the existing Aprop_C pipeline via the IsKeyedInteractable extension
// instead. ReliableKind slots 16 and 17 are dormant (see comment near the
// enum). The version stays at 9 because peers with v9 may still receive
// stale packets at those slots from old hosts; the dispatch ignores them.
// v8 (2026-05-27): PoseSnapshot grew 28 -> 32 bytes -- added `stateBits`
// (bit 0 = isInAir, derived from source CMC MovementMode == MOVE_Falling).
// Receiver drives the puppet AnimBP's useLegIK/rise off this bit so the foot
// IK trace doesn't plant feet during jumps. Same expansion shape leaves
// bits 1..7 reserved for future per-pose flags (crouched, KO, etc.).
// v7 (2026-05-26 NIGHT): Phase 5W weather sync. Adds
//   ReliableKind::WeatherState = 13 (continuous rain/snow/fog/wind state)
//   ReliableKind::LightningStrike = 14 (discrete strike events)
// Host-authoritative model: client suppresses its 5 scheduler UFunctions on
// AdaynightCycle_C via multi-slot interceptor and receives state via reliable
// pushes. See research/findings/votv-weather-DESIGN-2026-05-26.md.
// v6 (2026-05-26 PM): ItemActivatePayload grew 16 -> 24 bytes -- added float
// intensity + outerConeAngle + innerConeAngle + uint8 mode so the receiver can
// mirror the sender's EXACT cone shape (Phase 5F user feedback: puppet's
// flashlight was too bright AND focused-vs-spread mode wasn't synced).
// v3 (2026-05-23 PM): PoseSnapshot grew from 24 -> 28 bytes (added headYawDelta).
// Both peers must run v9; older packets are rejected at the header check. No
// back-compat layer (RULE 2 -- mod is pre-ship; bump cleanly).
// v10 (2026-05-28 PR-2): wire layer migrated to GameNetworkingSockets. The
// custom Hello / HelloAck / Bye / Ping / Pong / ReliableAck dispatch tags are
// gone (GNS owns handshake, RTT, acks); an old peer's packet would land
// on a dead MsgType branch even if the version check passed, so we bump
// the version to make the mismatch explicit at ParseHeader time.
// v11 (2026-05-28): adds ReliableKind::AssignPeerSlot. Host sends it
// to each client right after Connected with the slot it was assigned.
// Without this, clients would self-stamp peerSessionId=1 and two
// clients would silently self-echo-drop each other's ItemActivate.
// v12 (2026-05-28): MTA CClientElement adoption -- EntitySpawn.sessionId
// + EntityDestroy.sessionId renamed to .elementId (cosmetic; semantics
// already host-allocated Registry ids since the Tier 3 NPC migration).
// PropSpawnPayload + PropDestroyPayload gain an `elementId` field
// (uint32, +4 bytes each) carrying the SENDER's allocation-range
// ElementId for the prop.
//
// A2 (2026-05-29) -- payload-compatible: no field changes, but the
// sender-side rule for PropSpawn/PropDestroy.elementId is now ROLE-
// AWARE: host minted ids land in host range [1, kHostRangeSize); client
// minted ids land in peer range [kHostRangeSize, kMaxElements). Receivers
// call Registry::RegisterMirror at the sender's eid; cross-peer
// Registry::Get(eid) resolves to the wire-identity's actor on both sides.
// EntitySpawn / EntityDestroy still host-range only (NPC sync is host-
// authoritative; clients never broadcast NPC entity packets).
//
// v13 (2026-05-29) -- A4 Player Element wire migration:
//   - AssignPeerSlotPayload gains `hostElementId` (uint32, grows 4->8B).
//     Host stamps its local Player Element id; client RegisterMirrors
//     it in slot 0 so subsequent packets bearing host's senderElementId
//     resolve to a Player on the client side via Registry::Get.
//   - Join payload prepends `uint32 senderElementId` before the existing
//     [uint8 nicklen][nick bytes] format (grows by 4 bytes). Receiver
//     RegisterMirrors that eid in the sender's puppet slot.
//   - ItemActivatePayload, WeatherStatePayload, RedSkyPayload,
//     LightningStrikePayload: `peerSessionId` (uint8) field RETIRED in
//     favor of `senderElementId` (uint32). Sender stamps own local
//     Player Element id; receivers resolve via
//     coop::element::Registry::Get -> Player::PeerSlot() for routing,
//     compare against own local Element id for self-echo guard, and
//     (Weather/RedSky/Lightning) validate PeerSlot()==0 for host trust-
//     boundary. Element mirror creation handshake lives in AssignPeerSlot
//     + Join above. ItemActivatePayload grows 24->28B; WeatherStatePayload
//     20->24B; RedSky + LightningStrike stay the same total size.
//
// v14 (2026-05-29) -- B1 syncContext on wire (MTA m_ucSyncTimeContext
// adoption). Each packet that already carries `senderElementId` (or
// `hostElementId` for AssignPeerSlot) now also carries a `senderContext`
// uint8 (or `hostContext` for AssignPeerSlot) -- the 8-bit generation
// counter from the SENDER's local Player Element (Element::GetSyncContext).
// Receiver compares the wire byte against its mirror's local context (set
// at RegisterMirror via EstablishMirrorForSlot from the handshake byte)
// and drops the packet on mismatch. Defends against ElementId reuse:
// when a peer disconnects and reconnects on the same slot, their NEW
// Player Element gets a fresh per-process-monotonic context, so stale
// pre-disconnect packets stamped with the OLD context are visibly
// distinguishable from the new generation's packets. Without this byte
// an in-flight ItemActivate from the previous incarnation could be
// routed to the new puppet and toggle its flashlight at the wrong moment.
// Layout: 5 of 6 packets reuse existing `_pad` bytes (no size change);
// LightningStrikePayload grows 16->20B (no existing pad to steal).
// Sender stamps `senderContext = Registry::Get(selfEid)->GetSyncContext()`
// (via the lock-free `players::Registry::LocalPlayerSyncContext()`
// accessor that mirrors LocalPlayerElementId). Receivers fall through
// (no compare) when senderElementId is the 0 sentinel (boot/seed race).
//
// v15 (2026-05-29) -- audit follow-up E-2: extend B1 syncContext coverage
// to the prop-lifecycle packets that B1 missed. PropSpawnPayload and
// PropDestroyPayload already carry `elementId` (sender's allocation-range
// Prop Element id, v12/A2) but they do NOT carry the SENDER's Player
// Element generation byte. Same hazard as ItemActivate: a peer that
// disconnects mid-pickup and reconnects gets a fresh per-process-
// monotonic context; an in-flight stale PropSpawn/PropDestroy stamped
// with the previous incarnation's eid could be honored against the new
// generation. Wire shape: both payloads have spare pad after `elementId`
// already (PropSpawnPayload had `uint8_t _pad[3]` after physFlags;
// PropDestroyPayload had a trailing `uint32_t _pad`). Steal one byte
// for senderContext, keep the rest as pad -- ZERO size change to either
// payload, just a field rename + protocol bump. ParseHeader rejects
// pre-v15 packets so a stale ItemActivate-shape PropSpawn (mismatched
// pad byte meaning) can't slip through.
//
// v16 (2026-05-29) -- PR-FOUNDATION-1b: per-peer 32-bit session epoch in
// the packet HEADER, replacing the 8-bit per-payload senderContext byte.
// Two motivating defects in the v14/v15 design:
//   1. 8-bit aliases at 256 reconnect cycles. MTA shipped this width
//      for 15+ years and the wrap was masked by per-entity (not per-
//      peer) granularity + frequent state-change increments. VOTV's
//      Per-peer-Player-Element scheme increments once per process,
//      so the wrap was a real hazard within a long session.
//   2. 0-on-either-side passthrough (the "boot/seed race" gate at
//      event_feed.cpp:86 + the manual compares at lines 321/400)
//      defeated the defense entirely whenever the sender's local
//      Player Element hadn't been minted yet -- an in-flight stale
//      packet stamped 0 paired with a freshly-minted mirror at the
//      receiver bypassed every compare. W-1 audit finding.
//
// New design:
//   - PacketHeader.token (uint64_t, ALWAYS 0 since PR-2 GNS migration --
//     all WriteHeader call sites hardcoded /*token*/0; ParseHeader caller
//     reads into `uint64_t tokenUnused`) is split: low 4 bytes become
//     `uint32_t senderEpoch`, high 4 bytes become `uint32_t _reserved`
//     (kept 0 on send; future use TBD). PacketHeader stays 20 bytes.
//   - Session mints `ownEpoch_` via std::random_device at Start() --
//     non-zero (re-rolls on the 1/2^32 zero) so 0 unambiguously means
//     "not yet latched" at the receiver.
//   - Sender stamps `ownEpoch_` on every outbound packet header (4
//     WriteHeader sites: SendReliableToSlot, SendReliable fan-out,
//     SendMessageToConnection PoseSnapshot, SendMessageToConnection
//     PropPose).
//   - Receiver, per peerSlot, maintains `m_expectedEpoch[slot]` --
//     latched on first packet from the slot when value is 0; subsequent
//     packets must match exactly; mismatch -> drop with log.
//   - On disconnect (ResetPeerRemoteState) `m_expectedEpoch[slot] = 0`
//     so the next packet from the new connection at that slot re-latches.
//   - No separate epoch-handshake message: the host's AssignPeerSlot
//     packet's HEADER already carries the host's m_ownEpoch, and the
//     client's first Join carries the client's m_ownEpoch -- the
//     receiver latches via the header on the first packet, period.
//
// Per RULE 2 (no migration baggage), v14/v15 per-payload senderContext
// + Element::m_syncContext + players::Registry::LocalPlayerSyncContext
// + VerifySenderContext + the manual context compares at event_feed.cpp
// PropSpawn/PropDestroy sites are FULLY DELETED in this bump (not
// retained as a parallel gate). senderContext fields gone from
// PropSpawnPayload, PropDestroyPayload, ItemActivatePayload,
// WeatherStatePayload, RedSkyPayload, LightningStrikePayload, plus
// hostContext from AssignPeerSlotPayload, plus the Join payload's
// context byte. Pad bytes coalesced back; LightningStrikePayload
// shrinks 20->16 (it had no existing pad pre-v14 -- per the v14 comment
// block above -- so the byte goes with no trailing pad).
//
// v17 (2026-05-29) -- PR-FOUNDATION Tier 2 (host-relay topology) T2-1:
// adds ReliableKind::PlayerJoined (=19), the host's cross-peer identity
// broadcast so clients learn about EACH OTHER (not just the host). New
// wire vocabulary only -- no struct changes. The version bump makes a
// v16 peer's silent ignore of PlayerJoined (which would leave cross-peer
// puppets unidentified) a visible ParseHeader mismatch instead.
//
// v18 (2026-05-29) -- PR-FOUNDATION Tier 2 T2-2 (pose relay): carves a
// `senderSlot` byte out of the header's old `_reserved` (zero size change,
// header stays 20 B) so the host can RELAY a client's PoseSnapshot /
// PropPose to other clients tagged with the logical origin slot. Receiving
// clients route relayed poses by senderSlot. See PacketHeader doc.
//
// v19 (2026-05-30) -- player vitals pillar Inc1 (continuous display vitals):
// PoseSnapshot's 3 trailing `_pad` bytes become `healthFrac`/`foodFrac`/
// `sleepFrac` (each a [0,1] fraction quantized 0..255). ZERO wire-size change
// (PoseSnapshot stays 32 B). Per-peer-authoritative: each peer packs its OWN
// vitals (host packs host's, each client its own) off this machine's
// UsaveSlot_C via ue_wrap::vitals. DISPLAY-ONLY on the receiver -- drives the
// remote puppet's nameplate health bar; NEVER written to any saveSlot (one
// saveSlot per machine; a write would corrupt the local player's persisted
// health). Reliable death/ragdoll authority is a later increment (these bytes
// are continuous, lossy, and intentionally never trigger a DEAD transition).
// See research/findings/votv-player-vitals-death-RE-2026-05-30.md.
//
// v20 (2026-05-31) -- vitals pillar Inc2b (ragdoll/faint DISPLAY sync):
// PoseSnapshot.stateBits gains bit 1 `kStateBitRagdoll` (per-pose, per-peer-
// authoritative). The sender sets it from its OWN AmainPlayer_C::isRagdoll
// (excluding death -- death = native SP menu flow, ends the session). isRagdoll
// is flipped by EVERY ragdoll cause: manual C-key (InpActEvt_ragdoll_..._25),
// exhaustion faint(), and KO -- so this one bit covers all of them. The
// receiver reconciles the peer's puppet against the bit (ragdollMode(1,1,0) on
// rising, forceGetUp() on falling), self-healing + idempotent. ZERO wire-size
// change (stateBits byte already exists; bit 1 was reserved). DELIBERATE
// DIVERGENCE from the banked reliable-event design (PlayerRagdollState
// ReliableKind): faint is a TRANSIENT, lossy-tolerant, per-peer DISPLAY state
// with multiple causes and no readable passOut/death distinction, so the
// self-healing continuous-bit shape (sibling of kStateBitInAir + the v19 vitals
// piggyback, and MTA's CPlayerPuresyncPacket flag shape) is the root-cause-
// correct fit -- it rides the proven per-peer pose relay (no new ReliableKind /
// relay-whitelist / lane / defer-latch / connect-replay machinery, which existed
// only to survive the reliable design's permanent-desync failure mode).
//
// v22 (2026-06-01) -- ragdoll PHYSICS sync (the pelvis-attached puppet ragdoll
// learns the ragdolling peer's ACTUAL physics instead of free-simulating its own).
// v20's kStateBitRagdoll only synced the on/off STATE; the host then spawned an
// INDEPENDENT playerRagdoll_C body that flopped on the HOST's local PhysX -- so a
// client who ragdolled off a ledge and flew forward looked like a body flopping in
// place on the host (the gross motion did NOT match). This bump adds a new
// unreliable MsgType::RagdollPose (=16) -- a sibling of PropPose, sent only WHILE a
// peer is ragdolling -- carrying that peer's ragdoll PELVIS world transform +
// linear + angular velocity (read off its native AmainPlayer_C::ragdollActor's
// SkeletalMesh pelvis bone). The receiver feeds the velocity onto its mirror body's
// pelvis each packet (SetPhysicsLinearVelocity + SetPhysicsAngularVelocityInDegrees
// -- the SAME UPrimitiveComponent ops PropRelease uses) so the mirror body tumbles
// to TRACK the client, and drives the puppet's rotation from the streamed pelvis
// rotation directly (exact, no reliance on the host sim matching). MTA precedent:
// dead-reckoning a networked entity from a streamed transform + velocity is
// CClientPed's time-based interpolation shape (CClientPed.cpp:218 / 5405). Mirrors
// the prop pipeline exactly (PropPose continuous transform + PropRelease velocity,
// fused into one per-frame ragdoll packet). ParseHeader rejects pre-v22 peers so a
// v21 host (which has no RagdollPose dispatch) is a visible version mismatch rather
// than a silently-dropped packet.
// v23 (2026-06-01): WeatherStatePayload gains a fog flags2 byte (active-fog bits
// kFogActive/kSuperFogActive/kPermanentFog) for host-authoritative fog. Fog is
// driven by event ACTORS (AweatherFogController_C / AsuperFog_C), not the config
// enable_* bits -- the wire now carries actor PRESENCE so the client can destroy a
// stray fog actor on host-clear + mirror-spawn on host-fog. No wire-size change
// (the byte reuses a former _pad slot); ParseHeader rejects pre-v23 peers.
// v24 (2026-06-02): late-joiner WEATHER-LEVEL SNAP. WeatherStatePayload grows
// 24->40 (+rain target, +finalFogDensity, +fogAlpha, +fogStrength) so a joining
// client snaps to the host's CURRENT fog/rain levels instead of ramping up over
// ~3 min (the rolling-fog actor ramps its density from 0; a fresh client mirror
// did the same). The host copies its rolling-fog actor's Alpha+Strength onto the
// client mirror (fogprobe-proven the actor accepts the write + keeps ramping in
// lockstep) + the cycle's finalFogDensity, and anchors the rain ease target.
// ParseHeader rejects pre-v24 peers (the 16-byte payload growth would misparse).
// v25 (2026-06-02): held-clump ATTACH sync. The trash ball / chipPile-clump
// (prop_garbageClump_C) is non-Aprop_C AND non-keyable (autotest 33e7f25 proved
// setKey doesn't stick on it), so it can't ride the keyed PropSpawn/PropPose path
// the mannequin uses. Instead the holder broadcasts two reliable edges --
// HeldClumpGrab (=21) when a clump enters its hands, HeldClumpRelease (=22) when
// it leaves -- and each peer mirrors the clump by SPAWNING a copy and
// K2_AttachToComponent-ing it to the holder puppet's hand bone (the MTA attach
// model, same primitive as AttachActorToRagdollBody). The puppet hand is already
// pose-synced, so the attached clump follows the hand for free; on release the
// mirror detaches + re-enables physics + inherits the holder's throw velocity
// ("physics like the mannequin"). No per-tick clump stream, no key needed.
// ParseHeader rejects pre-v25 peers. [[project-bug-trash-chippile-uaf-crash]]
// v26 (2026-06-03): the held trash-clump is reworked to ride the MANNEQUIN prop
// pose pipeline (PropSpawn/PropPose/PropRelease) instead of the v25 hand-attach
// (RULE 2 -- attach was the wrong model: VOTV carries the clump via the physics
// grab, floating in front, like the mannequin). The clump is non-keyable, so
// PropPoseSnapshot grows 56->60 with an `elementId` and the receiver resolves the
// mirror by OUR eid when the Key is None. The v25 ReliableKinds HeldClumpGrab(21) /
// HeldClumpRelease(22) are RETIRED (RULE 2); their slots stay reserved. The clump is
// visible on its own (a bare spawn renders the 'dirtball' mesh), so no mesh transfer
// is needed. ParseHeader rejects pre-v26 peers (PropPosePacket grew 76->80).
// v27 (2026-06-03): Phase 5D keyed-interactable state sync -- base doors, light
// switches, and storage-container lids, all driven by ONE generic
// coop::interactable_sync Channel (no per-feature duplication, RULE 2). Three new
// ReliableKinds share KeyedTogglePayload (WireKey instance Key + action on/off):

//   LightState (=10)    -- Atrigger_lightRoot_C::SetActive
//   ContainerState (=11)-- Aprop_swinger_C::Open/Close (cabinet/fridge/safe lids)
// All SYMMETRIC (any peer's local edge broadcasts; host relays client<->client)
// + a host connect-snapshot of every OPEN instance to a late joiner. Identity =
// the instance's cross-peer-stable Key (AtriggerBase_C::Key for doors+lights;
// Aprop_C::Key for swinger lids). RE:
// research/findings/votv-doors-and-lightswitches-RE-2026-05-25.md. ParseHeader
// rejects pre-v27 peers. [[project-coop-doors-lights-sync]]
// v28 (2026-06-03): trash-clump DESPAWN + VARIANT fix. (a) PropDestroy is now
// EID-ROUTABLE: the non-keyable clump (prop_garbageClump_C, key=None) rides our eid
// for spawn (v26) but its morph-destroy is UNOBSERVABLE (native/BP-internal, bypasses
// the K2_DestroyActor observer -- proven hands-on), so the owner death-WATCHES each
// clump it broadcast and sends PropDestroy{key=None, elementId} the tick its actor
// dies; OnDestroy resolves the target by eid when the key is empty (symmetric with the
// eid-spawn; MTA Packet_EntityRemove resolves by element ID only). (b) PropSpawnPayload
// steals one _pad byte for `chipType` (the 14-value trash-variant enum at struct 0x0238
// on chipPile/clump) so a mirrored clump shows the SAME variant the owner grabbed
// (a bare spawn defaulted to variant 0 = the wrong-type bug). Struct size UNCHANGED
// (168 B). [[project-bug-trash-chippile-uaf-crash]]
// v29 (2026-06-03): trash LANDING SOUND. The owner-authoritative landed pile (the
// chipPile the owner's clump re-piled into, broadcast by trash_collect_sync's death-
// watcher) is a bare SpawnActor on the peer -- silent, because the flying mirror is
// despawned, never physically landed. Now BroadcastLandedPileNear stamps physFlags
// kFreshLanded + carries the clump's landing velocity in initLinVel, and the receiver
// dispatches AactorChipPile_C::turnToPile(Velocity) -- the SAME BP entry the real
// clump->pile landing calls (sets spwnd + fires impact dust+sound; operates on `this`,
// spawns nothing -> no dupe). Gated on kFreshLanded so the connect path can't replay it.
// Struct size UNCHANGED (168 B; reuses initLinVel). [[project-bug-trash-chippile-uaf-crash]]
// v30 (2026-06-04): SHARED HOST-AUTHORITATIVE BALANCE. New ReliableKinds BalanceSync (23,
// host->client absolute-total mirror, broadcast on Points change + connect-edge) +
// BalanceDelta (24, client->host signed-delta request, host applies via AddPoints). New

// credits (the +1000 dev button) route to the host. [[project-coop-shared-balance]]
// v34 (2026-06-06): CLIENT LOADING SCREEN brackets. Two new host->client markers wrap the
// connect-edge world snapshot so the joiner can show a determinate progress cover (a
// Source-style loading screen) instead of watching the world build itself: SnapshotBegin
// (27, sent FIRST in StartEnumerationFor carrying the prop candidate count) + SnapshotComplete
// (28, sent LAST after the per-tick prop drain finishes). Both ride Lane::Bulk -- the SAME
// ordered lane as PropSpawn -- so delivery is strictly Begin -> [every PropSpawn] -> Complete,

// places the joiner arrives earlier, behind the cover). MTA precedent: CTransferBox's

// v39 (2026-06-07): KERFUR HEAD-LOOK sync. EntityPoseSnapshot grows 28 -> 40 (adds the
// kerfur AnimBP `lookAt` FVector @0x2D90 -- the WORLD location the head/neck FAnimNode_LookAt
// nodes aim at) + a hasLookAt stateBit. RE (2 agents CONVERGED, byte-exact): the head-look is
// natively recomputed PER-PEER each tick as GetPlayerCameraManager(self,0).GetActorLocation()
// (the LOCAL player camera) unless the AnimBP `customLookAt` bool @0x2E49 is set -- so without
// sync each peer's kerfur stares at its own local player (user hands-on: "looked in another
// direction on client"). The host streams its kerfur's resolved lookAt; the client writes it
// onto the mirror's AnimInstance + sets customLookAt=true so the mirror's own BUA stops
// overwriting it and the native LookAt nodes aim at the host's target. The same native

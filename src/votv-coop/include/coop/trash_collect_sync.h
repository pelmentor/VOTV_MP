// coop/trash_collect_sync.h -- mirror a freshly-spawned-and-grabbed item
// (the VOTV trash-pile collect).
//
// Pressing E on a trashBitsPile_C ("trash stack") spawns one Aprop_C trash
// item and auto-grabs it into the player's hands the same frame. The item is
// born with Key == None (its BP UCS hasn't minted a NewGuid yet), so our
// held-prop pose stream emitted unmatchable PropPose key='None' AND the
// Init-POST broadcast skipped it -> the held item never mirrored to peers.
//
// We CANNOT catch the collect via a UFunction observer: trashBitsPile_C::
// playerTryToCollect is dispatched BP->BP (ProcessInternal), which bypasses
// our ProcessEvent detour entirely (verified hands-on: a POST observer
// installed but NEVER fired while the item was clearly held). So detection
// happens where the engine state IS visible -- net_pump's held-prop send,
// which already resolves the grabbing_actor every tick.
//
// EnsureHeldItemBroadcast is called on the NEW-held edge from that send: if
// the held actor is a freshly-spawned UNKEYED Aprop_C, it force-mints a stable
// Key and broadcasts a PropSpawn so every peer spawns a mirror. From there the
// existing grabbing_actor pose stream carries the item into the collector's
// hands, and PropRelease/PropDestroy unwind it like any held prop.
//
// CRASH-SAFE for the non-Aprop_C garbageClump/chipPile (the actual trash): we
// DO broadcast them, but the receiver never runs physics on them. GetStaticMesh
// returns null for non-Aprop_C, so the clump mirror spawns physics-free and is
// driven KINEMATICALLY (per-tick SetActorLocation, no mesh) -- the inverse of
// the reverted-2a use-after-free, which resolved their real mesh and physics-
// drove a self-morphing actor. [[project-bug-trash-chippile-uaf-crash]]

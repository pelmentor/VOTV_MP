// coop/roster.h -- thread-safe player-roster snapshot for the TAB scoreboard.
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7). The TAB scoreboard renders on the RENDER
// thread but the roster facts live in game-thread-owned state (Session connection
// slots + player_handshake's std::wstring nicknames). Reading those directly off
// the render thread would race the game thread, so this module snapshots them on
// the game thread (Refresh, called from a game-thread tick) into a small POD under
// a mutex; the render thread copies it out via GetSnapshot. No UFunction / UObject
// access here -- pure Session + nickname reads.
//
// Slot model (matches coop::players::Registry): slot 0 = host, 1..kMaxPeers-1 =
// clients. The local peer's slot is its LocalPeerId (host=0).

#pragma once

// coop/world_actor_sync.h -- HOST-AUTHORITATIVE mirror of NON-Character event actors (B3b, 2026-06-17).
//
// The "sync all events" arc (research/findings/events/votv-all-events-coop-sync-classification-2026-06-17.md,
// channel B3 / the B3b split) + the design doc votv-b3b-worldactor-mirror-design-2026-06-17.md.
// Mirrors the ~14 non-Character event actors (gray saucers, Rozital mothership, ariral ships, sky UFO,
// space jellyfish, firetank, ...) that fly in on events. The Character-only NPC mirror (npc_sync +
// npc_pose_drive) can't replicate them: it drives pos + YAW-ONLY rotation + DriveCharacterMovement
// (CMC@0x288, ACharacter-only). So this is a SELF-CONTAINED sibling of npc_sync -- its own
// coop::element::WorldActor element (transform-only, FULL rotation), its own MirrorManager<WorldActor>,
// its own wire (WorldActorSpawn/WorldActorDestroy reliable + MsgType::WorldActorPose unreliable batch),
// and its own SECOND interceptor on BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass (the WorldActor allowlist is
// DISJOINT from npc_sync's, so the two interceptors are conflict-free -- game_thread.h multi-interceptor
// support). It does NOT extend the kerfur-coupled Npc, and does NOT touch npc_sync.
//
// HOST-AUTHORITATIVE (clients run a dormant event scheduler -- time_sync pins their TimeScale=0 -- so
// they never fire an event themselves; the host is the sole event producer):
//   - host interceptor: an allowlisted spawn -> allocate a WorldActor Element + broadcast WorldActorSpawn
//     (reuse EntitySpawnPayload, savePersisted=0). Lets the spawn proceed (returns false).
//   - host POST observer (same UFunction): bind the returned AActor* + actor->eid reverse map.
//   - host K2_DestroyActor PRE observer: broadcast WorldActorDestroy + release the Element.
//   - host TickPoseStream (~sendHz): read each live WA's transform -> publish ONE WorldActorPose batch.
//   - client interceptor: SUPPRESS an allowlisted local spawn (defense-in-depth -- the dormant scheduler
//     shouldn't fire one anyway) unless the bypass slot matches a wire-received materialization.
//   - client OnWorldActorSpawn: materialize a transform-only mirror (BeginDeferred + FinishSpawning),
//     park it (SetActorTickEnabled(false) -- generic, no CMC read), Install into MirrorManager<WorldActor>.
//   - client OnWorldActorDestroy: K2_DestroyActor the mirror + drop the Element.
//   - client TickClientWorldActors: drain the latest WorldActorPose batch + drive every mirror's interp.
//   - host QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot: re-send WorldActorSpawn (+ current transform) for every live WA
//     to a fresh joiner so it mirrors actors that spawned before it joined.

// by npc_world_enum's source-gated Func-thunk and drained here next pump tick, post-Finish so
// the transform is real). Reaches the same end state as interceptor+POST: WorldActor Element +
// actor bind + reverse-map + WorldActorSpawn broadcast. Dedups against the interceptor path via
// the reverse map. Returns the element id, or 0 if not enrolled (gates/allowlist/alloc). Game
// thread (UFunction-free, but the reverse map + element store expect the pump context).

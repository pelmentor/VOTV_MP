// coop/event_feed.h -- coop session events surfaced to the on-screen feed.
//
// Gameplay/network layer (principle 7): decides WHAT lines the player sees and when,
// from coop/session state -- "X joined", "X left the game", connection errors. It
// drives the engine-side overlay through ue_wrap::hud_feed (which owns the widget).
//
// Mirrors MTA (research/findings/mta-chat-joinquit-reliability-2026-05-23.md): joins
// announce a nickname over the RELIABLE channel; the disconnect message is generated
// LOCALLY from the cause (MTA's quit-reason-enum pattern), not sent as a string.
//
// Game thread only (it calls hud_feed + reads the session).

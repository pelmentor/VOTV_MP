// ui/join_curtain.h -- instant-world UPPER layer (SEAM 1): the SHORT curtain.
//
// A full-viewport opaque cover the joining client raises at connect and DISMISSES with a
// smooth alpha-fade when the "primary world is assembled" (SnapshotComplete + spawn-drain --
// NOT full quiescence; see docs/COOP_INSTANT_WORLD_TWO_LAYER.md SEAM 1). It hides the rawest
// connect moment (the client's own save load-in, camera settle, the spawn burst, and the
// local-actor reposition jumps that deferred-spawn cannot hide because those are the engine's
// own actors). Because it lifts at SnapshotComplete (~2s BEFORE quiescence) it adds NO long
// blank screen -- the world fades in already-assembled, and the uncertain tail keeps resolving
// invisibly under mirror_defer.
//
// The cover draws on the ImGui BACKGROUND draw list -- ON TOP of the game world but BEHIND the
// loading panel -- so the panel stays legible while the curtain is up. Pure ImGui (our surface,
// our trigger), NOT the engine ClientSetCameraFade (whose co-op semantics are unpredictable).
//
// Game-thread / render-thread: Show/BeginDismiss/Reset are called from the join lifecycle
// (game thread); Render is called once per frame from the imgui overlay (the DX Present hook).

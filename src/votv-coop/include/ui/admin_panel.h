// Three sections (user spec 2026-07-05):
//   Online  -- every connected remote peer: full row (nick / ping / link) +
//              Teleport / Kick / Ban actions.
//   Offline -- every player this host has ever seen (coop::seen_players) that is
//              not currently online: nick + last seen + Ban action.
//   Banned  -- every persistent IP ban (coop::ban_list): nick / IP / date /
//              reason + Unban action.
//
// ROLE-gated, not dev-gated: the category is only offered to the HOST of a live
// coop session (dev_menu gates on coop::roster::LocalIsHost()); clients and
// solo players never see it. Render thread; all data comes from the modules'
// any-thread snapshot APIs, refreshed at ~2 Hz while the pane is open.

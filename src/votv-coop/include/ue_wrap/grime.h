// ue_wrap/grime.h -- standalone engine access for VOTV surface grime (Agrime_C +
// ~20 subclasses: grime_oil_C / grime_blood2_C / grime_dusty_C / ...). Principle-7
// engine-wrapper layer: wraps the reflection / struct-offset / UFunction-thunk details
// of a grime actor. NO network logic, NO gameplay/coop state -- coop::grime_sync owns
// those and talks to the engine through here.
//
// Agrime_C : AActor (directly -- NOT a save/trigger actor, so it has NO Key field; it is
// UNKEYED, persisted as a primitive JSON blob [type, process] indexed by save order). Its
// dirt is the whole-decal scalar `process`@0x0250 (float; higher = dirtier). The visible
// dirtiness is `process / maxProcess`@0x0268. A sponge wipe calls clean(sponge, Sub) which
// does `process -= Sub*cleanStrength*1.2` and, at `process < 0`, K2_DestroyActor()s the decal.
//
// Because a grime decal is STATIC (a level-placed decal with a saved transform that never
// moves), its WORLD POSITION is a deterministic cross-peer identity (both peers load the same
// save -> the same decal at the same transform). coop::grime_sync keys grime by a quantized
// world-position string, NOT by a host-allocated eid -- the decal's own position is its
// identity. (Runtime projectile-splatter grime, whose spawn position is non-deterministic, is
// out of scope for that model and deferred.)

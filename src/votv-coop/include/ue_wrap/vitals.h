// ue_wrap/vitals.h -- local-player vitals scalar accessor (engine substrate).
//
// Resolves the canonical live vitals store -- UmainGameInstance_C::save_gameInst
// (a UsaveSlot_C*, exactly ONE per machine) -- and reads/writes the player's
// vital scalars by reflected field offset. BP-cooked offsets shift across
// recooks, so every offset is resolved by NAME (never hardcoded). Game-thread
// only (UObject lookups + BP-state writes). NO network / coop / quantization
// logic (Principle 7): callers in coop/ own the wire encoding.
//
// CAUTION: there is exactly ONE saveSlot per machine -- every remote-player
// puppet AND the local player resolve to it. This accessor only ever touches the
// LOCAL player's vitals. NEVER use it to store a remote puppet's display health;
// that would corrupt the local player's persisted health. Puppet display health
// lives on coop::RemotePlayer.
//
// Extracted 2026-05-30 from coop/dev/restore_vitals.cpp (M-1/P7) so the
// player-vitals/death replication feature can read live health off the same
// proven chain. See research/findings/votv-player-vitals-death-RE-2026-05-30.md.

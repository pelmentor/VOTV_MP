// ue_wrap/walk_timer.h -- [WALK-TIME] profiling for periodic heavy passes (the L5 FPS-stutter hunt).
//
// WHY: a periodic full-GUObjectArray walk (FindObjectByClass / a NumObjects() loop / SnapshotActorsByType)
// runs on the GAME THREAD, so a pass that takes several ms IS a frame-time spike. The ~3-4s FPS stutter
// survived two one-at-a-time walk gates because we GUESSED which walk caused it instead of measuring.
// Wrap each periodic walk in a ScopedWalkTimer and the smoke log shows EXACTLY which pass ate the frame,
// with its duration -- profile the drop, don't assume. Only passes over the threshold log (a cheap/gated/
// skipped walk stays silent), so [WALK-TIME] lines ARE the frame-relevant passes, rankable by duration.
//
// The harness (tools/pile-test-assert.ps1) asserts the max [WALK-TIME] duration stays under a frame budget
// -- so an FPS regression (a new or un-gated heavy walk) FAILS the script instead of only being felt.
// Game-thread diagnostic; negligible cost (one steady_clock read per wrapped pass).

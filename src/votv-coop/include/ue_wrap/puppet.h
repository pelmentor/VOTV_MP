// ue_wrap/puppet.h -- the remote-player visible body, as a "skin-puppet".
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7). A puppet is a BARE actor (ASkeletalMeshActor)
// that wears the LOCAL player's exact skin (mesh_playerVisible's USkeletalMesh) and
// runs the same body AnimBP (UAnimBlueprint_kerfurOmega_regular_C), but is owned and
// driven entirely by us -- no pawn, no controller, no CharacterMovement.
//
// Root cause this replaces: a 2nd mainPlayer_C orphan posed as a "stick" because
// its AnimBP samples idle/zero owner-movement state with no controller, and it
// dragged the protagonist class's whole single-player tick surface (hijack/gamma
// cascade) along with it. Two converging agents + the CXX dump established the
// AnimBP poses purely from its own public variables and does NOT require a
// possessing controller (the SAME AnimBP is shared by NPC classes), so the right
// shape is OUR object driven by OUR data (RULE 1 root-cause; RULE 3 parallel class
// hierarchy). The AIController-poses-the-body path is retired (RULE 2).
//
// Every function calls a UFunction or touches engine memory -> game thread only.

// mesh-asset's "+Y forward" convention) CANNOT live as a sub-component offset
// here -- a root component's RelLoc/RelRot just compose into the world transform
// that SetActorLocation immediately overwrites. RemotePlayer applies the same
// shim at the ACTOR transform level instead (puppet.actor.Z = source.actor.Z +
// localMesh.RelLoc.Z; puppet.actor.Yaw = source.actor.Yaw + localMesh.RelRot.Yaw).

//     - headPitch: streamed view pitch, degrees. Wire contract is the
//       canonical FRotator axis range (-180, 180]; live values from VOTV's
//       camera-clamped source sit well inside (-89, 89).
//     - headYawDelta: head yaw RELATIVE to body (degrees). Currently always
//       streamed as 0 -- the source actor's body yaw already lags the camera
//       inside VOTV's Character, so the natural "head leads body" effect
//       reproduces on the puppet for free when we stream actor yaw. Param
//       kept for a future enhancement where the head's yaw lead is sent

// dump). Logs non-trivial floats + ints to pinpoint:
//   * Local BlendSpacePlayer.X offset (the walking-speed sample coordinate;
//     non-zero on walking local -- gives us the byte offset within the node).
//   * Local State Machine current state index vs puppet's (whether the puppet
//     is stuck on idle while the local is in walk).
// Call on BOTH local and puppet to diff. No-op-safe on null.

// Bug 2 root-cause fix (Plan B2, 2026-05-23):
//
// The AnimBP's BlueprintUpdateAnimation pulls velocity from
// Pawn->GetMovementComponent()->Velocity and uses it to populate spd,
// Movement, IK targets, and the bool packs the state machine reads. On a
// null-Pawn puppet, BUA short-circuits and the AnimInstance is vastly
// under-populated -> state machine stays in idle even with our spd writes.
//
// Earlier Plan B1 (intercept BUA via game_thread::SetInterceptor and skip
// the original) was retired because skipping BUA left ALL the other
// AnimInstance fields zero, not just spd. The full AnimBP_vars_all diff
// dump (2026-05-23) proved this empirically: 8 set fields on puppet vs ~26
// on local.
//
// Plan B2: RemotePlayer spawns a hidden, inert satellite ACharacter at
// puppet creation time, writes its CharacterMovementComponent.Velocity from
// the streamed pose each Tick, and points the puppet's AnimInstance.Pawn
// pointer at the satellite. BUA then runs naturally and pulls EVERY field
// it would on the local mainPlayer -- including the ones the state machine
// transitions read. The puppet animates the same way the local does.

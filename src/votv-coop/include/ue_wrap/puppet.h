// ue_wrap/puppet.h -- the remote-player visible body, as a "skin-puppet".
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7). A puppet is a BARE actor (ASkeletalMeshActor)
// that wears the LOCAL player's exact skin (mesh_playerVisible's USkeletalMesh) and
// runs the same body AnimBP (UAnimBlueprint_kerfurOmega_regular_C), but is owned and
// driven entirely by us -- no pawn, no controller, no CharacterMovement.
//
// Root cause this replaces: a 2nd mainPlayer_C orphan posed as a "stick" because
// its AnimBP samples idle/zero owner-movement state with no controller, and it
// dragged the protagonist class's whole single-player tick surface (hijack/gamma
// cascade) along with it. Two converging agents + the CXX dump established the
// AnimBP poses purely from its own public variables and does NOT require a
// possessing controller (the SAME AnimBP is shared by NPC classes), so the right
// shape is OUR object driven by OUR data (RULE 1 root-cause; RULE 3 parallel class
// hierarchy). The AIController-poses-the-body path is retired (RULE 2).
//
// Every function calls a UFunction or touches engine memory -> game thread only.

// null-Pawn puppet, BUA short-circuits and the AnimInstance is vastly
// under-populated -> state machine stays in idle even with our spd writes.
//
// Earlier Plan B1 (intercept BUA via game_thread::RegisterInterceptor and

// dump (2026-05-23) proved this empirically: 8 set fields on puppet vs ~26
// on local.
//
// Plan B2: RemotePlayer spawns a hidden, inert satellite ACharacter at
// puppet creation time, writes its CharacterMovementComponent.Velocity from
// the streamed pose each Tick, and points the puppet's AnimInstance.Pawn
// pointer at the satellite. BUA then runs naturally and pulls EVERY field
// it would on the local mainPlayer -- including the ones the state machine
// transitions read. The puppet animates the same way the local does.

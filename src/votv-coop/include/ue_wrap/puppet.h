// ue_wrap/puppet.h -- the remote-player visible body, as a "skin-puppet".
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7). A puppet is a BARE actor (ASkeletalMeshActor)
// that wears the LOCAL player's exact skin (mesh_playerVisible's USkeletalMesh) and
// runs the same body AnimBP (UAnimBlueprint_kerfurOmega_regular_C), but is owned and
// driven entirely by us -- no pawn, no controller, no CharacterMovement.
//
// Root cause this replaces: a 2nd mainPlayer_C orphan posed as a "stick" because
// its AnimBP samples idle/zero owner-movement state with no controller, and it
// dragged the protagonist class's whole single-player tick surface (hijack/gamma
// cascade) along with it. Two converging agents + the CXX dump established the
// AnimBP poses purely from its own public variables and does NOT require a
// possessing controller (the SAME AnimBP is shared by NPC classes), so the right
// shape is OUR object driven by OUR data (RULE 1 root-cause; RULE 3 parallel class
// hierarchy). The AIController-poses-the-body path is retired (RULE 2).
//
// Every function calls a UFunction or touches engine memory -> game thread only.

// ue_wrap/passwordlock.h -- standalone engine access for VOTV password keypads
// (ApasswordLock_C). Principle-7 engine-wrapper layer: it wraps the reflection /
// struct-offset / UFunction-thunk details of a keypad actor. NO network logic, NO
// gameplay/coop state -- coop::keypad_sync owns those and drives the keypad mirror
// through here.
//
// A keypad is an AtriggerBase_C descendant that gates a door. Cross-peer identity is
// the inherited AtriggerBase_C::Key FName (deterministic placed-trigger key, save-
// persistent; v31 proved it stable, keysHash 0xF75D.../14).
//
// HOW THE MIRROR WORKS (RE-and-probe-proven 2026-06-04; refined by the BP disassembly
// 2026-06-06 -- research/findings/computers-devices/votv-keypad-door-BP-disassembly-2026-06-06.md):
//   * Every keypad verb (Open / inputNumber / focusOn / SetActive) dispatches BP-internally
//     (CallFunction -> ProcessInternal, bypassing our ProcessEvent detour), so a POST observer
//     NEVER fires on them -> the sync POLLS state, it cannot observe verbs.
//   * inputNumber(digit) IS callable and APPENDS to inPassword natively (display + beep come
//     for free), and it drives the keypad's OWN native validator (Len>=5 && inPassword==
//     password -> open). So the receiver mirrors TYPING by replaying inputNumber -- pure MTA
//     input-replication: on the HOST, replaying the client's digits makes the host's native
//     keypad accept the code itself (no guessed output mirror, no unreachable submit verb).
//   * We DO NOT mirror isAcc/isDeny: the disassembly proved they are crosshair-HOVER flags
//     (lookAt: isAcc = crosshair-over-key_acc), NOT accept/deny state -- writing both onto a
//     mirror was the non-native green+red "PURPLE" the user reported. The door lock keys on the
//     DOOR's own `Active` (ue_wrap::door::CanOpen), never the keypad's isAcc. upd() repaints the
//     digit DISPLAY after a buffer change (so a native clear wipes the panel).
//   * We DO mirror the keypad's own `active` (bool @0x0330): the BP disassembly
//     (votv-keypad-door-BP-disassembly-2026-06-06.md, cancel trace) proved this is the LED
//     SELECTOR -- `upd` picks eff_glow_red when `!isReset && !active`, green when active. The
//     cancel button calls `open(false)` which sets `active=false` (CFG 848: self.active =
//     SwitchValue(self.false){case0:arg}) -> red. `active` also == the door's power/lock (setActive
//     propagates `door.active = self.active`). It is a real persistent state, NOT a hover flag, so
//     mirroring it (direct field-write + upd repaint, never the `setActive` verb -> never fires
//     powerChanged, which is the LIGHT-actor "purple", a different bug) reproduces the cancel-red on
//     every peer + keeps coop=SP (keypad.active==door.active). Wrong-CODE red already mirrors via the
//     inPassword digit replay (the host's native open(false) fires); this closes the EXPLICIT cancel
//     button gap (a cancel types no digit, so the buffer mirror alone misses it).

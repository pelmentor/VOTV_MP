// ue_wrap/wisp.h -- standalone engine access for the VOTV Killer Wisp
// (Akillerwisp_C / FName "killerwisp_C"). Principle-7 engine-wrapper layer: it wraps
// the reflection / struct-offset details of a killerwisp actor. NO network logic, NO
// gameplay/coop state -- coop::wisp_attack_sync (and the dev probe) own those and read
// the wisp's resolved FSM state through here.
//
// THE WISP IS AN ACharacter (killerwisp.hpp:4) so it already rides the NPC pose-mirror
// pipeline (coop::npc_sync). What this wrapper adds is the read side of its attack FSM:
//   * Target  @0x0610 (APawn*)  -- who it ACQUIRED (proximity+LOS+nearest over the
//     {mainPlayer_C, kerfurOmega_C, fossilhound_C} class allow-set; our client puppets
//     are mainPlayer_C orphans so they're already valid targets).
//   * grab    @0x0600 (bool)    -- the lift/tear is in progress.
//   * tryGrab @0x05D8 (bool)    -- a grab is being attempted (precedes grab).
//   * killed  @0x0618 (bool)    -- the fatality committed.
//   * harmless@0x0658 (bool)    -- the wisp is in its non-lethal/idle mode.
// THE LOAD-BEARING SP FACT (RE, votv-event-system / wisp findings): the grab/tear/KILL
// steps in the wisp's ubergraph operate on GetPlayerPawn(0)/getMainPlayer() -- the LOCAL
// player -- NOT on `Target`. So on the host the wisp always grabs+kills the HOST even
// when `Target` is a client puppet. coop::wisp_attack_sync polls these fields to learn
// the REAL victim (Target) vs who the BP physically grabbed (always the host), and to
// drive the cross-peer mirror. The grab/kill verbs themselves dispatch BP-internally
// (EX_LocalVirtualFunction / EX_CallMath), so they are INVISIBLE to our ProcessEvent
// detour -- polling the resolved fields is the only host-side observation path (the same
// reason keypad_sync / door_sync POLL rather than observe).

// ue_wrap/drone.h -- standalone engine access for the VOTV delivery DRONE (Adrone_C).

// host-authoritative pose mirror through here.
//
// Adrone_C : AActor (direct) is the SINGLETON delivery drone (one per save, world-placed; NOT
// the player-piloted recon Aprop_rdrone_C). Its flight is a per-tick BP float integrator in
// ReceiveTick (Damping/Speed/Pitch/vecForce vs a world Spline) -- reproducing it bit-exact on a
// remote is fragile, so we HOST-AUTHORITATIVELY stream the resolved actor TRANSFORM and the client
// mirrors it kinematically (SuppressTick stops the client drone's own ReceiveTick so it can't fly
// on its own + fight the stream -- the npc/clump mirror discipline). The drone moves the ACTOR
// (not a physics body), so actor-level GetActorLocation/SetActorLocation is the transform.
//
// Identity = SINGLETON (resolve via FindObjectByClass(drone_C); both peers load the same placed
// drone). It has no top-level Key (its key lives inside Data@0x0410) -- but a singleton needs no
// key. State we read: Active@0x0370 (dormant<->flying).

// The CLIENT suppresses the drone's ReceiveTick, which also kills the tick-driven FX: the
// rotor-wash DUST (eff_droneDust @0x0278) and the delivery "items ready" alarm cue (audio_alarm
// @0x0230 + light_alarm @0x0240). Bytecode RE (research/pak_re/drone_dust_notes.md): the drone's
// tick sphere-traces 2000uu down each tick and (1) SetActive(hit, false) on an IsActive!=hit edge,
// (2) K2_SetWorldLocation's eff_droneDust to the ground hit -- the component is bAbsoluteLocation
// with NO relative offset, so unmoved it sits at WORLD ORIGIN (invisible: frustum-culled fixed
// bounds), and (3) SetFloatParameter('dust', 1 - dist/2000) (a [0,1] RateScale). The PS is
// EmitterLoops=1/20s -- it self-completes and needs the per-tick IsActive!=want re-arm. So the
// HOST streams the FX bits + the dust component's world location in DroneState (20 Hz while
// Active) and the CLIENT replays the BP's exact three calls per packet (ApplyDustMirror). The
// alarm cue fires on the canTakeOff false->true edge (drone within 25cm of its drop). Pose RE:

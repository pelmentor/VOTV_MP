// ue_wrap/atv.h -- standalone engine access for the VOTV ATV/quadbike (AATV_C).
// Principle-7 engine-wrapper layer (NO network/coop state). coop::atv_sync drives the
// kinematic pose-stream sync through here.
//
// AATV_C : APawn is a CUSTOM physics rig (NOT a UWheeledVehicleMovementComponent vehicle):
// the root Mesh@0x0570 simulates PhysX, the wheels are constraint-driven. There is no movement
// component to feed input into on a remote -- the body transform is the only ground truth -> we
// kinematic POSE-STREAM it (like the kerfur/NPC pose stream + held-prop PropPose), NOT input-
// replication. On the mirror the local physics + tick are disabled (PrepareMirror) so the ATV's
// own applyWheelTorque/gravity can't fight the streamed transform (the clump/NPC-mirror
// discipline). Identity = the save-placed Key@0x0618 (cross-peer stable).
//
// Mesh@0x0570 IS the actor ROOT component, so the actor transform == the physics body transform
// -- we read/drive at the ACTOR level (GetActorLocation/Rotation/Velocity, SetActorLocation/
// Rotation), reusing ue_wrap::engine; no component-transform plumbing needed.

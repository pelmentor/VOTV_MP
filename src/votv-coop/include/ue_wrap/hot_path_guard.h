// ue_wrap/hot_path_guard.h -- enforce the game-thread-only invariant on
// side-tables that are GT-only BY CONVENTION (no lock), making the implicit
// rule explicit and catching the first future violator.
//
// Engine-substrate layer (principle 7): the only thing it knows is "which
// thread is the game thread" (ue_wrap/game_thread.h). No coop/gameplay state.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (audit theme #4, research/findings/votv-architecture-audit-
// 2026-05-29.md): a class of side-tables (g_drives, g_remoteNickBySlot,
// g_puppets, players::Registry's playerBySlot_; threats T-7/T-8/T-10) is
// touched only from the game thread and is therefore safe WITHOUT a mutex --
// but nothing ENFORCES that. Every new subsystem inherits the implicit rule
// and can introduce a silent off-thread access that data-races these tables.
//
// THE FIX IS A TRIPWIRE, NOT A LOCK. Adding a mutex to single-thread state
// would be a RULE-1 crutch: it would mask the real bug (an access that should
// never have left the game thread) instead of surfacing it. So this guard does
// NOT synchronize and does NOT change behaviour. On a PROVEN off-game-thread
// access it:
//   - emits a bounded ERROR log (first kMaxFiresPerSite per call site, then
//     goes silent so a hot loop can't spam the log), and
//   - in DEBUG builds, breaks into the debugger (hard stop for the developer).
// In Release (NDEBUG, our shipping/smoke config) the break compiles out, so a
// violation is a loud-but-non-fatal log line -- exactly what we want in a LAN
// smoke: it shows up without killing the host.
//
// It fires on ue_wrap::game_thread::IsDefinitelyOffGameThread(), which is true
// ONLY when the game thread id is already known AND the caller differs -- never
// for "don't know yet" (boot, before the first ProcessEvent dispatch). So a
// guard placed on a boot-time path that runs before the detour does not
// false-fire; conversely, a boot-time path that runs AFTER the detour on a
// non-game thread (e.g. the harness session-bringup thread) WOULD fire, which
// is why guards go on the per-message/per-tick GT hot path, not on one-shot
// session-start helpers that run on the bringup thread.

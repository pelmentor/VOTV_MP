# Project rules for Claude — VOTV_MP (Voices of the Void coop mod)

This project adds functional multiplayer / coop to **Voices of the Void**
(VOTV), a single-player **Unreal Engine 4.27** game, **without modifying
any original game files**.

For any coop / multiplayer architecture decision, consult
`docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md` AND `reference/mtasa-blue/` (conceptual
precedent) AND `reference/RE-UE4SS/` (the UE4 modding substrate we build
on). After any non-trivial coop work, spawn an MTA-fidelity audit agent
(WP2 in the methodology).

## RULE №1 — No crutches, no quick fixes

Always pick the proper root-cause fix. No "good enough", no "we can fix
later", no shortcuts. Weeks or months of work to do it properly is OK.

When you find yourself adding a workaround (filter, skip-if, suppress-X,
catch-and-ignore), **STOP**. That is a crutch. Identify the root cause and
fix it at the point where the actual problem is, not broadly.

## RULE №2 — No migration baggage

When a feature is replaced or retired, the old code goes. Fully,
immediately. No "deprecated but kept for now", no feature flags for old
behaviour, no parallel old + new code paths.

Triggers: `// deprecated, kept for now` comments; flags that re-enable old
behaviour; two implementations of one concept compiled together; type
aliases kept "for compatibility"; stub functions for old callers.

## RULE №3 — Standalone mod; UE4SS is a tool, not a dependency

The shipping mod is **standalone**: its own loader (proxy DLL), its own
engine reflection (resolve `GUObjectArray` / `GNames` / `ProcessEvent` via
AOB signatures), its own UFunction/native hooking. It must run with **no
UE4SS present**.

UE4SS is a **development tool only** — used for: the reflection dumps (our
SDK), the Lua probes, and the autonomous test harness (`tools/probes/*`).
None of that ships. Anything under `src/votv-coop/` must not depend on
UE4SS at runtime; all engine/substrate access goes behind `ue_wrap/` so the
loader/reflection/hook implementation is swappable. The CXX header dump is
our standalone SDK. (Dropping UE4SS later is RULE №2: it goes fully, no
UE4SS-and-not-UE4SS dual paths.)

## The 7 architectural principles

1. **No modification of original game files.** Hooks, UFunction hooks,
   reflection-driven patches, runtime memory patches — yes. Editing the
   `.exe`, the `.pak`, cooked assets, or repacking — **no**. Editing a
   blueprint asset to add replication counts as editing assets (anti-
   pattern A6); route around it.
2. **Engine-extension paradigm.** Treat the mod as a new engine layer on
   top of UE4 + VOTV, not "a few hooks". Modules own their lifecycles;
   clean APIs between subsystems.
3. **Parallel class hierarchy mirroring engine structures.** Our code owns
   a `RemotePlayer` (network state, interpolation buffer, input buffer,
   ownership of the engine entity pointer). The **engine** `APawn` /
   `ACharacter` / `APlayerController` owns rendering, animation, physics
   — keep it. Connected by a pointer. (MTA shape:
   `CClientPed::m_pPlayerPed -> CPlayerPed*`.)
4. **Targeted crash fixes, not broad suppression.** Find the specific call
   site; patch THAT site. Never a broad "filter all our orphans"
   mechanism. Transitional-crutch exception only with a written
   retirement plan (each crash masked, the targeted fix, gating criteria).
5. **Minimum viable subset.** `docs/COOP_SCOPE.md` is law. Anything not
   listed there is NOT replicated. Living document; amend with audit trail.
6. **Augment SP, never replace it.** Coop is layered ON single-player.
   Route per-player inside SP systems (P1 path stays, P2 path added
   alongside) rather than bypassing SP wholesale.
7. **Engine-wrapper layer vs gameplay/network layer.** Two separate
   subtrees:
   - `src/votv-coop/.../ue_wrap/` — one class per UE/VOTV engine class.
     Wraps reflection access, struct layouts, UFunction thunks. **No
     network logic, no gameplay logic, no coop state.**
   - `src/votv-coop/.../coop/` — network packets, interpolation, input
     buffers, `RemotePlayer`. Talks to the engine through `ue_wrap`.
   Communicate via clean APIs, not shared globals.

## UE4-specific adaptation of the methodology

`docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md` was written around native-engine RE (GTA:SA /
MTA). VOTV is UE4.27 — a known, documented engine. The principles are
unchanged; the *techniques* shift:

- **Discovery is reflection, not blind RE.** UE exposes every class,
  property, and function via `GUObjectArray` / `GNames`. UE4SS surfaces
  this. Phase 1 "engine archaeology" is mostly reflection introspection,
  not IDA work. Drop to raw RE only for things reflection can't see.
- **Injection / hooking is UE4SS, not hand-rolled MinHook.** UE4SS owns
  the injection, the UFunction hook engine, and Blueprint mod loading.
  WP13 (use established libraries) → UE4SS is that library here.
- **"Spawn the orphan" = spawn a 2nd `APawn` + `APlayerController`.** UE
  natively supports multiple controllers/pawns (split-screen, listen
  servers do it). The factory is `UWorld::SpawnActor`. This is far less
  crash-prone than the GTA orphan, but VOTV's SP-only assumptions will
  still need per-site fixes (principle 4).
- **MTA stays the conceptual precedent** for the parallel class hierarchy,
  the keysync packet, sessions, host-authoritative AI, cutscene sync. The
  *shapes* port; the *mechanism* is UE4SS.
- **Do NOT rely on UE's built-in replication for gameplay.** VOTV's
  blueprints were authored single-player (no `Replicated` props, no RPCs).
  Adding them means editing assets (A6). We run a custom UDP layer and
  drive the engine via replicated *input* + state push.

## Versioning — mirror the game version

The mod's version tag **mirrors the VOTV game version it targets**, to avoid
confusion about compatibility. The current target is **Alpha 0.9.0-n**
(the latest game release), so the mod is tagged `0.9.0-n`. When the mod is
brought up against a future game release, it carries that release's tag.
The game install folder name (`Game_0.9.0n/`) reflects the current target.

## Other standing rules

- Document findings + rename functions/objects (in IDB if doing RE; in
  research findings always). Verify, don't guess (WP4/WP18 — memory
  decays, current code/reflection is authority).
- **When stuck/lost, ask agents (RULE).** If an approach has failed more than
  once or the root cause is unclear, STOP guessing and spawn parallel sub-agents
  (feature-dev:code-architect for design; general-purpose to mine the SDK
  dumps/methodology) with the full context, instructed to follow RULE №1. Two
  independent agents converging is strong signal. (This is how the
  auto-possess root cause was found: agents pinpointed `APawn::AutoPossessPlayer`
  + the deferred-spawn prevention window.)
- **After shipping, audit with agents (RULE).** Whenever code is built + deployed
  for a test, spawn agent(s) to audit the shipped change BEFORE/while the user
  tests it — above all for **performance**: no per-frame full-array scans (e.g.
  `FindObjectByClass`/GUObjectArray walks every frame), no heavy work on hot paths
  (anything running per `ProcessEvent` / per tick), no FPS-eating patterns; also
  thread-safety (engine UFunctions are game-thread only) and correctness. The goal
  is to catch dumb costly solutions before the user feels them. (Born from a real
  120→60 fps drop: a per-`ProcessEvent` observer + a per-frame `FindObjectByClass`.)
  Draw on the curated audit prompts in `reference/agency-agents/` to brief the
  audit agents (code-reviewer, security-engineer, autonomous-optimization-architect,
  testing-performance-benchmarker, testing-reality-checker).
  **Every audit prompt MUST also include a file-size / modularity check:**
  any touched file approaching or exceeding the soft cap (see modular rule below)
  must be flagged with an extraction proposal. Born from a gap caught
  2026-05-25: 14 successive Inc-* commits each individually fine, none flagging
  that harness.cpp had silently grown to 3,126 LOC.

- **Modular file-size rule (RULE 2026-05-25, post-harness.cpp-bloat).**
  - **Soft cap: 800 LOC per .cpp/.h.** Past 800, an audit MUST flag the file
    with a proposed extraction.
  - **Hard cap: 1500 LOC.** A commit that pushes a file past 1500 is rejected
    by the audit unless it's a single-feature file (e.g. `protocol.h` is a
    constants header that may legitimately grow).
  - **One feature per file.** When adding a new feature subsystem, it gets
    its own `.cpp/.h` pair under the right principle-7 subtree
    (`coop/` for gameplay/network, `ue_wrap/` for engine substrate). Glue
    code only goes in `harness.cpp` if it's truly boot/scenario glue.
  - **Extraction triggers:** if the file you're about to touch is past the
    soft cap AND your new code is conceptually a distinct subsystem,
    extract first (separate commit) then add the new code in its own file.
    Avoids ballooning the existing file further.
  - **Existing oversized files** (catalog as of 2026-05-25 PM): `harness.cpp`
    (3126 LOC — refactor in progress), `engine.cpp` (1247 LOC — UMG helpers
    should split out), `remote_prop.cpp` (885 LOC — near soft cap). These
    are NOT exempt; they're called out so future work consciously avoids
    growing them and opportunistically extracts on touch.
- **Verify behaviour by diffing observable state, not just hooks.** UE4SS
  UFunction hooks only fire on ProcessEvent-dispatched calls; native engine
  paths (Possess, EnableInput, auto-possess) bypass them. To catch those,
  snapshot the relevant object PROPERTIES (e.g. `PC.Pawn`, `ViewTarget`,
  `pawn.Controller`) immediately before vs after the trigger and diff.
- **Escalation ladder when stuck.** Reflection/dumps are the first tool. If
  stuck (offsets/layout/a crash you can't explain from reflection alone),
  drop to **IDA** (IDA Pro MCP available) — decompile the exact call site,
  read the real struct layout / param sizes / the faulting instruction. If
  stuck *in IDA* too (e.g. need live behaviour, BP graph semantics, or a fast
  reflected truth), use **UE4SS** as the dev probe (Lua dumps / live
  inspection). Order: reflection → IDA → UE4SS. None of IDA/UE4SS ship
  (RULE №3); they are diagnosis tools only.
- **Screenshots during hands-on tests:** `HighResShot` pops a distracting
  "saving screenshot" toast — never use it in the hands-on `play` scenario.
  Screenshots are only for autonomous (agent-run) verification scenarios.
- Don't reinvent the wheel (WP13). Hooks/reflection: UE4SS.
- Mod menu / debug overlay: Dear ImGui (UE4SS ships an ImGui integration).
- Plain-English UI labels; technical depth in `(?)` tooltips (WP10).
- No emojis in code / files unless explicitly requested.
- **Testing loads only a recent, fresh save** (made with the current game
  version). Prefer New Game — always fresh. Never auto-load old/stale saves
  (e.g. 2023-2024 slots); they risk version-mismatch and confusing results.
